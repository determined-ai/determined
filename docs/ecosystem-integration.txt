Determined is focused on helping teams of deep learning engineers train better models more quickly.
However, Determined is also designed to easily integrate with other popular ML ecosystem tools for
tasks that are related to model training, such as ETL, ML pipelines, and model serving. The `Works
with Determined <https://github.com/determined-ai/works-with-determined>`__ repository includes
examples of how to use Determined with a variety of ML ecosystem tools, including Pachyderm, DVC,
Delta Lake, Seldon, Spark, Argo, Airflow, and Kubeflow.
