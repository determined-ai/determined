   For your security, set strong passwords for any service accessible from the internet. 
   Malicious actors are always scanning for vulnerabilities. Unauthorized access to your 
   cluster could lead to data breaches, unauthorized processes like crypto mining, high costs, 
   and disruptions to legitimate usage.
