.. note::

   A new cluster deployed with the :ref:`Helm Chart <helm-config-reference>` includes two default
   users, ``admin`` and ``determined``. You must either configure an initial password for the these
   default users or deactivate them.

   The ``initialUserPassword`` for these user accounts is configured in the :ref:`Helm Chart <helm-config-reference>`.
   For additional information on managing users in determined, visit the :ref:`topic guide on users <users>`.
