 Grid Method
#############

The ``grid`` search method generates trials on a "grid" of hyperparameter configurations and trains
each trial for the number of training units specified by ``max_length``. The user specifies a set of
values for each hyperparameter via the ``hyperparameters`` field in the :ref:`experiment
configuration <experiment-configuration_hyperparameters>`. The "grid" of hyperparameter
configurations is generated by taking the `product
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product>`__ of these sets. For example, if the set of
values for three separate hyperparameters ``aparam``, ``bparam``, and ``cparam`` are specified as
``{0, 1, 2}``, ``{10, 20}``, and ``{"c"}`` respectively, then the grid of tuples ``(aparam, bparam,
cparam)`` generated is:

.. code::

   (0, 10, "c")
   (0, 20, "c")
   (1, 10, "c")
   (1, 20, "c")
   (2, 10, "c")
   (2, 20, "c")

The way the set of hyperparameter values is specified depends on the type of hyperparameter:

-  ``const``: The set of values contains just the single value. For example, ``cparam`` above could
   be specified as a ``const`` hyperparameter with ``val: c``.

-  ``categorical``: The set of values is exactly the set of categorical values. For example,
   ``bparam`` above could be specified as a ``categorical`` hyperparameter with ``vals: [10, 20]``.

-  ``int``: The set of ``count`` values is taken evenly from the range ``[minval, maxval]``,
   inclusive of endpoints. If ``count`` is larger than the number of integer values in the range,
   that is interpreted as the entire range of integers in ``[minval, maxval]``. For example,
   ``aparam`` above could be specified as an ``int`` hyperparameter with ``minval: 0``, ``maxval:
   2``, and ``count: 3`` or ``count: 100``.

-  ``double``: The set of ``count`` values is taken evenly from the range ``[minval, maxval]``,
   inclusive of endpoints. The set ``{0.1, 0.3, 0.5}`` could be specified as a ``double``
   hyperparameter with ``minval: 0.1``, ``maxval: 0.5``, ``count: 3``.

-  ``log``: The set of ``count`` values is taken logarithmically evenly from the range
   ``[base^minval, base^maxval]``, inclusive of endpoints. For example, the set ``{0.00001, 0.0001,
   0.001}`` could be specified as a ``log`` hyperparameter with ``base: 10``, ``minval: -5``,
   ``maxval: -3``, and ``count: 3``.

In the special case of ``count: 1`` for ``int``, ``double``, or ``log``, the midpoint (with rounding
for ``int`` and with base midpoint for ``log``) is returned.
