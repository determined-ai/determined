 Single Search Method
######################

The ``single`` search method does a very minimal "search": it trains a single hyperparameter
configuration to completion. This method is useful for testing or for training a single model
configuration until convergence.

See :ref:`Experiment Configuration <experiment-configuration_searcher>`.
