 Quickstart
************

If you are new to Determined, visit the :ref:`Quickstart for Model Developers <qs-mdldev>` where
you'll learn how to perform the following tasks:

-  Train on a local, single CPU or GPU.
-  Run a distributed training job on multiple GPUs.
-  Use hyperparameter tuning.

 Train Your Model in Determined
********************************

:ref:`Training API Guides <apis-howto-overview>` include the :ref:`api-core-ug` and walk you through
how to take your existing model code and train your model in Determined.

**********
 Examples
**********

Examples let you build off of an existing model that already runs on Determined. Visit our
:ref:`Examples <example-solutions>` to see if the model you'd like to train is already available.
