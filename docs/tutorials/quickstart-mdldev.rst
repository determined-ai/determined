#################################
 Quickstart for Model Developers
#################################

This quickstart uses the MNIST dataset to demonstrate basic Determined functionality and walks you
through the steps needed to install Determined, run training jobs, and visualize experiment results
in your browser. Three examples show the scalability and enhanced functionality gained from simple
configuration setting changes:

-  Train on a local, single CPU or GPU.
-  Run a distributed training job on multiple GPUs.
-  Use hyperparameter tuning.

An *experiment* is a training job that consists of one or more variations, or trials, on the same
model. By calling Determined API functions from your training loops, you automatically get metric
frequency output, plots, and checkpointing for every experiment without writing extra code. You can
use the WebUI to view model information, configuration settings, output logs, and training metrics
for all of your experiments.

Each of these quickstart examples uses the same model code and example dataset, differing only in
their configuration settings. For a list of all experiment configuration settings and more detailed
information about each, visit the :ref:`Experiment Configuration Reference
<experiment-config-reference>`.

***************
 Prerequisites
***************

Software
========

-  Determined *agent* and *master* nodes must be configured with Ubuntu 16.04 or higher, CentOS 7,
   or macOS 10.13 or higher.

-  Agent nodes must have Docker installed.

-  To run jobs with GPUs, install NVIDIA drivers, version 384.81 or higher, on each agent. The
   drivers can be installed as part of a CUDA installation but the rest of the CUDA toolkit is not
   required.

Hardware
========

-  Master node:

   -  At least 4 CPU cores, Intel Broadwell or later. The master node does not require GPUs.
   -  8GB RAM
   -  200GB of free disk space.

-  Agent Node:

   -  At least 2 CPU cores, Intel Broadwell or later.
   -  If you are using GPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with compute capability 3.7 or greater are required: K80,
      P100, V100, A100, GTX 1080, GTX 1080 Ti, TITAN, or TITAN XP.
   -  4GB RAM
   -  50GB of free disk space.

Docker
======

Install Docker to run containerized workloads. If you do not already have Docker installed, visit
:ref:`Install Docker <install-docker>` to learn how to install and run Docker on Linux or macOS.

******************************
 Quickstart Training Examples
******************************

Download and extract the files used in this quickstart to a local directory:

#. Download link: :download:`mnist_pytorch.tgz <../examples/mnist_pytorch.tgz>`.

#. Extract the configuration and model files:

   .. code:: bash

      tar xzvf mnist_pytorch.tgz

You should see the following files in the ``mnist_pytorch`` directory:

.. code::

   adaptive.yaml
   const.yaml
   data.py
   distributed.yaml
   layers.py
   model_def.py
   README.md

Configuration
=============

Each of the YAML-formatted configuration files corresponds to one of the following example
experiments:

+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Configuration Filename | Example Experiment                                   |
+========================+======================================================+
| ``const.yaml``         | Train a single model on a single GPU/CPU, with       |
|                        | constant hyperparameter values.                      |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ``distributed.yaml``   | Train a single model using multiple, distributed     |
|                        | GPUs.                                                |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ``adaptive.yaml``      | Perform a hyperparameter search using the Determined |
|                        | adaptive hyperparameter tuning algorithm.            |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+

Model and Pipeline Definition
=============================

Although the Python model and data pipeline definition files are not explained in this quickstart,
you might want to review them to see how to call the Determined API from your code:

+------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Filename         | Experiment Type                                                        |
+==================+========================================================================+
| ``data.py``      | Model data loading and preparation code.                               |
+------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``layers.py``    | Convolutional layers used by the model.                                |
+------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``model_def.py`` | Model definition and training/validation loops.                        |
+------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

After gaining basic familiarity with Determined tools and operations, you can replacing these files
with your model data and code, and setting configuration parameters for the kind of experiments you
want to run.

.. _quickstart-submit-experiment:

*****************************************
 Run a Local Single CPU/GPU Training Job
*****************************************

This exercise trains a single model for a fixed number of batches, using constant values for all
hyperparameters on a single *slot*. A slot is a CPU or GPU computing device, which the master
schedules to run.

#. To install the Determined library and start a cluster locally, enter:

   .. code:: bash

      pip install determined
      det deploy local cluster-up

   If your local machine does not have a supported NVIDIA GPU, include the ``no-gpu`` option:

   .. code:: bash

      pip install determined
      det deploy local cluster-up --no-gpu

#. In the ``mnist_pytorch`` directory, create an experiment specifying the ``const.yaml``
   configuration file:

   .. code:: bash

      det experiment create const.yaml .

   The last dot (.) argument uploads all of the files in the current directory as the *context
   directory* for your model. Determined copies the model context directory contents to the trial
   container working directory.

   You should receive confirmation that the experiment is created:

   .. code:: console

      Preparing files (.../mnist_pytorch) to send to master... 8.6KB and 7 files
      Created experiment 1

   .. tip::

      To automatically stream log messages for the first trial in an experiment to ``stdout``,
      specifying the configuration file and context directory, enter:

      .. code:: bash

         det e create const.yaml . -f

      The ``-f`` option is the short form of ``--follow``.

#. Enter the cluster address in the browser address bar to view experiment progress in the WebUI. If
   you installed locally using the ``det deploy local`` command, the URL is
   ``http://localhost:8080/``. Accept the default ``determined`` username and click **Sign In**. No
   password is required.

   .. image:: /assets/images/qs01c.png
      :width: 704px
      :align: center
      :alt: Dashboard

   The figure shows two experiments. Experiment **11** has **COMPLETED** and experiment **12** is
   still **ACTIVE**. Your experiment number and status can differ depending on how many times you
   run the examples.

#. While an experiment is in the ACTIVE, training state, click the experiment name to see the
   **Metrics** graph update for your currently defined metrics:

   .. image:: /assets/images/qs04.png
      :width: 704px
      :align: center
      :alt: Metrics graph detail

   In this example, the graph displays the loss.

#. After the experiment completes, click the experiment name to view the trial page:

   .. image:: /assets/images/qs03.png
      :width: 704px
      :align: center
      :alt: Trial page

With this fundamental understanding of Determined, you are ready to scale to distributed training in
the next example.

***************************************
 Run a Remote Distributed Training Job
***************************************

In the distributed training example, a Determined cluster comprises a master and one or more agents.
The master provides centralized management of the agent resources.

This example requires a Determined cluster with multiple GPUs and, while it does not fully
demonstrate the benefits of distributed training, it does show how to work with added hardware
resources.

The ``distributed.yaml`` configuration file for this example is the same as the ``const.yaml`` file
in the previous example, except that a ``resources.slots_per_trial`` field is defined and set to a
value of ``8``:

.. code:: yaml

   resources:
     slots_per_trial: 8

This is the number of available GPU resources. The ``slots_per_trial`` value must be divisible by
the number of GPUs per machine. You can change the value to match your hardware configuration.

#. To connect to a Determined master running on a remote instance, set the remote IP address and
   port number in the ``DET_MASTER`` environment variable:

   .. code:: bash

      export DET_MASTER=<ipAddress>:8080

#. Create and run the experiment:

   .. code:: bash

      det experiment create distributed.yaml .

   You can also use the ``-m`` option to specify a remote master IP address:

   .. code:: bash

      det -m http://<ipAddress>:8080 experiment create distributed.yaml .

#. To view the WebUI dashboard, enter the cluster address in your browser address bar, accept the
   default ``determined`` username, and click **Sign In**. A password is not required.

#. Click the **Experiment** name to view the experimentâ€™s trial display. The loss curve is similar
   to the single-GPU experiment in the previous exercise but the time to complete the trial is
   reduced by about half.

*********************************
 Run a Hyperparameter Tuning Job
*********************************

This example demonstrates hyperparameter search. The example uses the ``adaptive.yaml``
configuration file, which is similar to the ``const.yaml`` file in the first example but includes
additional hyperparameter settings:

.. code:: yaml

   hyperparameters:
     global_batch_size: 64
     learning_rate:
       type: double
       minval: .0001
       maxval: 1.0
     n_filters1:
       type: int
       minval: 8
       maxval: 64
     n_filters2:
       type: int
       minval: 8
       maxval: 72
     dropout1:
       type: double
       minval: .2
       maxval: .8
     dropout2:
       type: double
       minval: .2
       maxval: .8

Hyperparameter searches involve multiple trials or model variations per experiment. The
configuration settings tell the search algorithm the ranges to explore for each hyperparameter.

The ``adaptive_asha`` search method and maximum number of trials, max_trials` are also specified:

.. code:: yaml

   searcher:
     name: adaptive_asha
     metric: validation_loss
     smaller_is_better: true
     max_trials: 16
     max_length:
       batches: 937

This example uses a fixed batch size and searches on dropout size, filters, and learning rate. The
``max_trials`` setting of ``16`` indicates how many model configurations to explore.

#. Create and run the experiment:

   .. code:: bash

      det experiment create adaptive.yaml .

#. To view the WebUI dashboard, enter your cluster address in the browser address bar, accept the
   default determined username, and click **Sign In**. No password is required.

#. The experiment can take some time to complete. You can monitor progress in the WebUI Dashboard by
   clicking the **Experiment** name. Notice that more trials have started:

   .. image:: /assets/images/qs05.png
      :width: 704px
      :align: center
      :alt: Trials graphic

   Determined runs the number of ``max_trials`` trials and automatically starts new trials as
   resources become available. For 16 trials, it should take about 10 minutes to train with at least
   one trial performing at about 98 percent validation accuracy. The hyperparameter search halts
   poorly performing trials.
