To launch a notebook, start by installing the :ref:`Determined
command-line interface <install-cli>` on a development machine.

Once the CLI is installed, try launching your first notebook with the
``det notebook start`` command:

.. code::

   $ det notebook start
   Scheduling notebook unique-oyster (id: 5b2a9ea4-a6bb-4d2b-b42b-25e4064a3220)...

   Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8080/proxy/5b2a9ea4-a6bb-4d2b-b42b-25e4064a3220-notebook-0/lab/tree/Notebook.ipynb?reset

After the notebook has been scheduled onto the cluster, the Determined
CLI will open a web browser window pointed to that notebook's URL. Back
in the terminal, you can use the ``det notebook list`` command to see
that this notebook is one of those currently ``RUNNING`` on the
Determined cluster:

.. code::

   $ det notebook list
    Id                                   | Entry Point                                            | Registered Time              | State
   --------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------+---------

Since the lifecycle management of Jupyter notebooks in Determined is
left up to the user, this notebook will continue running until it is
explicitly shut down. To terminate the notebook, you can use the ``det
notebook kill`` command:

.. code::

   $ det notebook kill 5b2a9ea4-a6bb-4d2b-b42b-25e4064a3220
   Killed notebook 5b2a9ea4-a6bb-4d2b-b42b-25e4064a3220

****************************
 Using the CLI in Notebooks
****************************

The Determined CLI is installed into notebook containers by default.
This allows users to interact with Determined from inside a
notebook---e.g., to launch new deep learning workloads or examine the
metrics from an active or historical Determined experiment. For example,
to list Determined experiments from inside a notebook, run the notebook
command ``!det experiment list``.
