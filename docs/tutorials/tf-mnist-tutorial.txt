 TensorFlow Keras Fashion MNIST Tutorial
#########################################

This tutorial describes how to port an existing ``tf.keras`` model to
Determined. We will port a simple image classification model for the
Fashion MNIST dataset. This tutorial is based on the official
`TensorFlow Basic Image Classification Tutorial
<https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification>`__.

***************
 Prerequisites
***************

-  Access to a Determined cluster. If you have not yet installed
   Determined, refer to the :ref:`installation instructions
   <install-cluster>`.

-  The Determined CLI should be installed on your local machine. For
   installation instructions, see :ref:`here <install-cli>`. After
   installing the CLI, configure it to connect to your Determined
   cluster by setting the ``DET_MASTER`` environment variable to the
   hostname or IP address where Determined is running.

**********
 Overview
**********

To use a TensorFlow model in Determined, you need to port the model to
Determined's API. For most models, this porting process is
straightforward, and once the model has been ported, all of the features
of Determined will then be available: for example, you can do
:ref:`distributed training <multi-gpu-training>` or :ref:`hyperparameter
search <hyperparameter-tuning>` without changing your model code, and
Determined will store and visualize your model metrics automatically.

When training a ``tf.keras`` model, Determined provides a built-in
training loop that feeds batches of data into your model, performs
backpropagation, and computes training metrics. Determined also handles
evaluating your model on the validation set, as well as other details
like checkpointing, log management, and device initialization. To plug
your model code into the Determined training loop, you define methods to
perform the following tasks:

-  initialization
-  build the model graph
-  load the training dataset
-  load the validation dataset

The Determined training loop will then invoke these functions
automatically. These methods should be organized into a **trial class**,
which is a user-defined Python class that inherits from
:class:`determined.keras.TFKerasTrial`. The following sections walk
through how to write your first trial class and then how to run a
training job with Determined.

The complete code for this tutorial can be downloaded here:
:download:`fashion_mnist_tf_keras.tgz
</examples/fashion_mnist_tf_keras.tgz>`. After downloading this file,
open a terminal window, extract the file, and ``cd`` into the
``fashion_mnist_tf_keras`` directory:

.. code::

   tar xzvf fashion_mnist_tf_keras.tgz
   cd fashion_mnist_tf_keras

We suggest you follow along with the code as you read through this
tutorial.

************************
 Building a Trial Class
************************

Here is what the skeleton of our trial class looks like:

.. code:: python

   import keras
   from determined.keras import TFKerasTrial, TFKerasTrialContext


   class FashionMNISTTrial(TFKerasTrial):
       def __init__(self, context: TFKerasTrialContext):
           # Initialize the trial class.
           pass

       def build_model(self):
           # Define and compile model graph.
           pass

       def build_training_data_loader(self):
           # Create the training data loader. This should return a keras.Sequence,
           # a tf.data.Dataset, or NumPy arrays.
           pass

       def build_validation_data_loader(self):
           # Create the validation data loader. This should return a keras.Sequence,
           # a tf.data.Dataset, or NumPy arrays.
           pass

We now discuss how to implement each of these methods in more detail.

Initialization
==============

As with any Python class, the ``__init__`` method is invoked to
construct our trial class. Determined passes this method a single
parameter, :class:`~determined.TrialContext`. The trial context contains
information about the trial, such as the values of the hyperparameters
to use for training. For the time being, we don't need to access any
properties from the trial context object, but we assign it to an
instance variable so that we can use it later:

.. code:: python

   def __init__(self, context: TFKerasTrialContext):
       # Store trial context for later use.
       self.context = context

Building the Model
==================

The :meth:`~determined.keras.TFKerasTrial.build_model` method returns a
compiled ``tf.keras.Model`` object. The Fashion MNIST model code uses
the Keras Sequential API and we can continue to use that API in our
implementation of ``build_model``. The only minor difference is that the
model needs to be wrapped by calling :func:`self.context.wrap_model()
<determined.keras.TFKerasTrialContext.wrap_model>` before it is
compiled.

.. code:: python

   def build_model(self):
       model = keras.Sequential(
           [
               keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
               keras.layers.Dense(self.context.get_hparam("dense1"), activation="relu"),
               keras.layers.Dense(10),
           ]
       )
       model = self.context.wrap_model(model)
       model.compile(
           optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(name="Adam"),
           loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
           metrics=[tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name="accuracy")],
       )
       return model

Loading Data
============

The last two methods we need to define are
:meth:`~determined.keras.TFKerasTrial.build_training_data_loader` and
:meth:`~determined.keras.TFKerasTrial.build_validation_data_loader`.
Determined uses these methods to load the training and validation
datasets, respectively.

Determined supports three ways of loading data into a ``tf.keras``
model: as a `tf.keras.utils.Sequence
<https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/Sequence>`__,
a `tf.data.Dataset
<https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset>`__, or as a
pair of NumPy arrays. Because the dataset is small, the Fashion MNIST
model represents the data using NumPy arrays.

.. code:: python

   def build_training_data_loader(self):
       train_images, train_labels = data.load_training_data()
       train_images = train_images / 255.0

       return train_images, train_labels

The implementation of ``build_validation_data_loader`` is similar:

.. code:: python

   def build_validation_data_loader(self):
       test_images, test_labels = data.load_validation_data()
       test_images = test_images / 255.0

       return test_images, test_labels

For more information on loading data in Determined, refer to the
tutorial on :ref:`data-access`.

********************
 Training the Model
********************

Now that we have ported our model code to the trial API, we can use
Determined to train a single instance of the model or to do a
hyperparameter search. In Determined, a :ref:`trial <concept-trial>` is
a training task that consists of a dataset, a deep learning model, and
values for all of the model's hyperparameters. An :ref:`experiment
<concept-experiment>` is a collection of one or more trials: an
experiment can either train a single model (with a single trial), or it
can perform a search over a user-defined hyperparameter space.

To create an experiment, we start by writing a configuration file which
defines the kind of experiment we want to run. In this case, we want to
train a single model for five epochs, using fixed values for the model's
hyperparameters:

.. code:: yaml

   description: fashion_mnist_keras_const
   hyperparameters:
       global_batch_size: 32
       dense1: 128
   records_per_epoch: 50000
   searcher:
       name: single
       metric: val_accuracy
       max_length:
         epochs: 5
   entrypoint: model_def:FashionMNISTTrial

For this model, we have chosen two hyperparameters: the size of the
``Dense`` layer and the batch size. Training the model for five epochs
should reach about 85% accuracy on the validation set, which matches the
original ``tf.keras`` implementation.

The ``entrypoint`` specifies the name of the trial class to use. This is
useful if our model code contains more than one trial class. In this
case, we use an entrypoint of ``model_def:FashionMNISTTrial`` because
our trial class is named ``FashionMNISTTrial`` and it is defined in a
Python file named ``model_def.py``.

For more information on experiment configuration, see the
:ref:`experiment configuration reference <experiment-configuration>`.

***********************
 Running an Experiment
***********************

The Determined CLI can be used to create a new experiment, which will
immediately start running on the cluster. To do this, we run:

.. code::

   det experiment create const.yaml .

Here, the first argument (``const.yaml``) is the name of the experiment
configuration file and the second argument (``.``) is the location of
the directory that contains our model definition files. You may need to
configure the CLI with the network address where the Determined master
is running, via the ``-m`` flag or the ``DET_MASTER`` environment
variable. For more information, see the :ref:`CLI reference page <cli>`.

Once the experiment is started, you will see a notification:

.. code::

   Preparing files (../fashion_mnist_tf_keras) to send to master... 2.5KB and 4 files
   Created experiment xxx

**********************
 Evaluating the Model
**********************

Model evaluation is done automatically for you by Determined. To access
information on both training and validation performance, simply go to
the WebUI by entering the address of the Determined master in your web
browser.

Once you are on the Determined landing page, you can find your
experiment either via the experiment ID (xxx) or via its description.
