 Log Management
################

This guide covers two log management features: Log Search and Log Signal.

************
 Log Search
************

To perform a log search:

#. Navigate to your run in the WebUI.
#. In the Logs tab, start typing in the search box to open the search pane.
#. To use regex search, click the "Regex" checkbox in the search pane.
#. Click on a search result to view it in context, with logs before and after visible.
#. Scroll up and down to fetch new logs.

Note: Search results are not auto-updating. You may need to refresh to see new logs.

************
 Log Signal
************

Log Signal allows you to configure log policies in the master configuration to display labels in the
UI when specific patterns are matched in the logs.

To set up a log policy:

#. In the master configuration file, under ``task_container_defaults > log_policies``, define your
   log policies.
#. Each policy can have a ``name``, ``pattern``, and ``action``.
#. When a log matching the pattern is encountered, the ``name`` will be displayed as a label in the
   run table and run detail views.

Example configuration:

.. code:: yaml

   log_policies:
      - name: "CUDA OOM"
        pattern: ".*CUDA out of memory.*"
        action:
          type: cancel_retries

This will display a "CUDA OOM" label in the UI when a CUDA out of memory error is encountered in the
logs.

For more detailed information on configuring log policies, refer to the :ref:`experiment
configuration reference <config-log-policies>`.
