   :description: Learn how to run your first experiment in Determined by working with the PyTorch MNIST model. You'll need only a single CPU or GPU.
   :keywords: PyTorch API,MNIST,model developer,quickstart

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll show you how to integrate a training example with the Determined
environment. We'll run our experiment on a local training environment requiring only a single CPU or
GPU.

.. note::

   This tutorial is recommended as an introduction for model developers who are new to Determined
   AI.

**Objective**

Our goal is to integrate the `PyTorch MNIST training example
<https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/main/mnist/main.py>`_ into Determined in four steps:

-  Download and extract the files
-  Set up our training environment
-  Run the experiment
-  View the experiment in our browser

**Prerequisites**

-  :doc:`Installation Requirements </setup-cluster/deploy-cluster/on-prem/requirements>`

********************
 Download the Files
********************

To get started, we'll first download and extract the files we need and ``cd`` into the directory.

-  Download the :download:`mnist_pytorch.tgz </examples/mnist_pytorch.tgz>` file.
-  Open a terminal window, extract the files, and ``cd`` into the ``mnist_pytorch`` directory:

.. code::

   tar xzvf mnist_pytorch.tgz
   cd mnist_pytorch

**********************************
 Set Up Your Training Environment
**********************************

To start your experiment, you'll need a Determined cluster. If you are new to Determined AI
(Determined), you can install the Determined library and start a cluster locally:

.. code::

   pip install determined

   # If your machine has GPUs:
   det deploy local cluster-up

   # If your machine does not have GPUs:
   det deploy local cluster-up --no-gpu

.. include:: ../_shared/note-pip-install-determined.txt

********************
 Run the Experiment
********************

To run the experiment, enter the following command:

.. code::

   det experiment create const.yaml . -f

A notification displays letting you know the experiment has started.

.. code::

   Preparing files (.../mnist_pytorch) to send to master...
   Created experiment xxx

*********************
 View the Experiment
*********************

To view the experiment progress in your browser:

-  Enter the following URL: ``http://localhost:8080/``.

This is the cluster address for your local training environment.

-  Accept the default ``determined`` username, leave the password empty, and click **Sign In**.

 Next Steps

In four simple steps, we've successfully configured our training environment in Determined to start
training the PyTorch MNIST example.

In this article, we learned how to run an experiment on a local, single CPU or GPU. To learn how to
change your configuration settings, including how to run a distributed training job on multiple
GPUs, visit the :ref:`Quickstart for Model Developers <qs-mdldev>`.
