   :description: Discover how to perform simple metrics reporting using Determined's detached mode.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through how to perform simple metrics reporting using :ref:`detached
mode <detached-mode-index>`.

For the full script, visit the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/blob/main/examples/features/unmanaged/1_singleton.py>`_.

************
 Objectives
************

These step-by-step instructions walk you through the following tasks:

-  Setting up your training environment
-  Importing and initializing the core context
-  Setting the master address and executing your training script

Upon completing this user guide, you will:

-  Grasp the concept and application of detached mode
-  Successfully report metrics in detached mode
-  Navigate and visualize trials using the Determined WebUI

**********************************
 Set Up Your Training Environment
**********************************

To begin, you'll need a Determined cluster. If you are new to Determined, you can install the
Determined library and start a cluster locally.

-  Ensure you have Docker running and then run the following command:

   .. code::

      pip install determined

      # If your machine has GPUs:
      det deploy local cluster-up

      # If your machine does not have GPUs:
      det deploy local cluster-up --no-gpu

   .. include:: ../../_shared/note-pip-install-determined.txt

********************************************
 Step 1: Import and Initialize the Core API
********************************************

Start by importing the necessary modules for your training code:

.. code:: python

   import random
   from determined.experimental import core_v2

Initialize the core context to recognize the trial with some identifying metadata in the main
function:

.. code:: python

   def main():
       core_v2.init(
           config=core_v2.Config(
               name="detached_mode_example",
           ),
       )

Report your trial and validation metrics:

.. code:: python

   for i in range(100):
       core_v2.train.report_training_metrics(steps_completed=i, metrics={"loss": random.random()})
       if (i + 1) % 10 == 0:
           loss = random.random()
           print(f"validation loss is: {loss}")
           core_v2.train.report_validation_metrics(
               steps_completed=i, metrics={"loss": loss}
           )
   core_v2.close()

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()

*************************************************************
 Step 2: Set Master Address and Execute Your Training Script
*************************************************************

Define the Determined master address:

.. code:: bash

   export DET_MASTER=<DET_MASTER_IP:PORT>

Run your training script:

.. code:: bash

   python3 <my_training_script.py>

Visualize the metrics! Navigate to ``<DET_MASTER_IP:PORT>`` in your web browser to see the
experiment.
