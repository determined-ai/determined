Trial API: PyTorch MNIST Tutorial
=================================

This tutorial describes how to port an existing PyTorch model to Determined. We will port a simple image classification model for the MNIST dataset. This tutorial is based on the official `PyTorch MNIST example <https://github.com/PyTorch/examples/blob/master/mnist/main.py>`_.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Access to a Determined cluster. If you have not yet installed Determined, refer to the :ref:`installation instructions <install-cluster>`.
- Access to the Determined CLI on your local machine. See :ref:`the installation instructions <install-cli>` if you do not already have it installed. After installing the CLI, configure it to connect to your Determined cluster by setting the ``DET_MASTER`` environment variable to the hostname or IP address where Determined is running.

Overview
--------

To use a PyTorch model in Determined, you need to port the model to Determined's API. For most models, this porting process is straightforward, and once the model has been ported, all of the features of Determined will then be available: for example, you can do :ref:`distributed training <multi-gpu-training>` or :ref:`hyperparameter search <hyperparameter-tuning>` without changing your model code, and Determined will store and visualize your model metrics automatically.

When training a PyTorch model, Determined provides a built-in training loop that feeds batches of data into your batch training function, where you can perform forward pass, backpropagation, and training metrics computation. Determined also handles checkpointing, log management, and device initialization. To plug your model code into the Determined training loop, you define methods to perform the following tasks:

- initialize the models, optimizers, and LR schedulers
- define the training function for forward and backward passes
- load the training data set
- load the validation data set

The Determined training loop will then invoke these functions automatically. These methods should be organized into a **trial class**, which is a user-defined Python class that inherits from :class:`determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial`. The following sections walk through how to write your first trial class and then how to run a training job with Determined.

The complete code for this tutorial can be found here: `mnist_pytorch <https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/tree/master/examples/official/trial/mnist_pytorch>`_. We suggest you follow along with the code as you read through this tutorial.

Building a ``PyTorchTrial`` Class
---------------------------------

Here is what the skeleton of our trial class looks like:

.. code:: python

    import torch.nn as nn
    from determined.pytorch import DataLoader, PyTorchTrial, PyTorchTrialContext

    class MNISTTrial(PyTorchTrial):
        def __init__(self, context: PyTorchTrialContext):
            # Initialize the trial class and wrap the models, optimizers, and LR schedulers.
            pass

        def train_batch(self, batch: TorchData, model: nn.Module, epoch_idx: int, batch_idx: int):
            # Run the training forward passes on the models and backward passes on the optimizers
            pass

        def evaluate_batch(self, batch: TorchData, model: nn.Module):
            # Define how to evaluate the model by calculating loss and other metrics.
            # for a batch of validation data.
            pass

        def build_training_data_loader(self):
            # Create the training data loader.
            # This should return a determined.pytorch.Dataset.
            pass

        def build_validation_data_loader(self):
            # Create the validation data loader.
            # This should return a determined.pytorch.Dataset.
            pass

We now discuss how to implement each of these methods in more detail.

Initialization
""""""""""""""

As with any Python class, the ``__init__`` method is invoked to construct our trial class.
Determined passes this method a single parameter, an instance of :class:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext`,
which inherits from :class:`~determined.TrialContext`.
The trial context contains information about the trial, such as the values of the hyperparameters to use for training.
All the models and optimizers must be wrapped with ``Model`` and ``Optimizer`` respectively provided by :class:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext`.
This MNIST model code uses the Torch Sequential API and ``torch.optim.Adadelta``.
The current values of the model's hyperparameters can be accessed via the :func:`~determined.TrialContext.get_hparam` method of the trial context.

.. code:: python

    from determined.pytorch import reset_parameters

    def __init__(self, context: PyTorchTrialContext):
        # Store trial context for later use.
        self.context = context

        # Initialize the models and wrap them with self.context.Model().
        self.model = self.context.Model(nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(1, self.context.get_hparam("n_filters1"), 3, 1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(
                self.context.get_hparam("n_filters1"), self.context.get_hparam("n_filters2"), 3,
            ),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2),
            nn.Dropout2d(self.context.get_hparam("dropout1")),
            Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(144 * self.context.get_hparam("n_filters2"), 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout2d(self.context.get_hparam("dropout2")),
            nn.Linear(128, 10),
            nn.LogSoftmax(),
        ))
        reset_parameters(self.model)

        # Initialize the optimizers and wrap them with self.context.Optimizer().
        self.optimizer = self.context.Optimizer(
            torch.optim.Adadelta(model.parameters(), lr=self.context.get_hparam("learning_rate"))
        )

Loading Data
""""""""""""

The last two methods we need to define are ``build_training_data_loader`` and ``build_validation_data_loader``. Determined uses these methods to load the training and validation datasets, respectively. This method should return a :ref:`determined.pytorch.DataLoader <pytorch-data-loading>`, which is very similar to ``torch.utils.data.DataLoader``.

.. code:: python

    def build_training_data_loader(self):
        if not self.data_downloaded:
            self.download_directory = data.download_dataset(
                download_directory=self.download_directory,
                data_config=self.context.get_data_config(),
            )
            self.data_downloaded = True

        train_data = data.get_dataset(self.download_directory, train=True)
        return DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=self.context.get_per_slot_batch_size())

    def build_validation_data_loader(self):
        if not self.data_downloaded:
            self.download_directory = data.download_dataset(
                download_directory=self.download_directory,
                data_config=self.context.get_data_config(),
            )
            self.data_downloaded = True

        validation_data = data.get_dataset(self.download_directory, train=False)
        return DataLoader(validation_data, batch_size=self.context.get_per_slot_batch_size())

For more information on loading data in Determined, refer to the tutorial on :ref:`data-access`.

Defining the Training Function
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``train_batch`` method runs the forward passes on the losses and backward passes on the optimziers with a single batch of data. Determined expects a dictionary with the calculated loss and other user-defined metrics and will automatically average all the metrics across batches. Since ``step_optimizer`` handles the backpropagation call and zeroing out the gradients so there is no need to call ``optim.zero_grad()``.

.. code:: python

    def train_batch(self, batch: TorchData, model: nn.Module, epoch_idx: int, batch_idx: int):
        batch = cast(Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor], batch)
        data, labels = batch

        # Define the training forward pass and calculate loss.
        output = model(data)
        loss = torch.nn.functional.nll_loss(output, labels)

        # Define the training backward pass and run optimization step.
        self.context.backward(loss)
        self.context.step_optimizer(self.optimizer)

        return {"loss": loss}

    def evaluate_batch(self, batch: TorchData, model: nn.Module):
        batch = cast(Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor], batch)
        data, labels = batch

        output = model(data)
        validation_loss = torch.nn.functional.nll_loss(output, labels).item()

        pred = output.argmax(dim=1, keepdim=True)
        accuracy = pred.eq(labels.view_as(pred)).sum().item() / len(data)

        return {"validation_loss": validation_loss, "accuracy": accuracy}


Training the Model
------------------

Now that we have ported our model code to the trial API, we can use Determined to train a single instance of the model or to do a hyperparameter search. In Determined, a :ref:`trial <concept-trial>` is a training task that consists of a dataset, a deep learning model, and values for all of the model's hyperparameters. An :ref:`experiment <concept-experiment>` is a collection of one or more trials: an experiment can either train a single model (with a single trial), or can define a search over a user-defined hyperparameter space.

To create an experiment, we start by writing a configuration file that defines the kind of experiment we want to run. In this case, we want to train a single model for a fixed number of batches, using fixed values for the model's hyperparameters:

.. code:: yaml

    description: mnist_pytorch_const
    data:
      url: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/determined-ai-test-data/pytorch_mnist.tar.gz
    hyperparameters:
      learning_rate: 1.0
      global_batch_size: 64
      n_filters1: 32
      n_filters2: 64
      dropout1: 0.25
      dropout2: 0.5
    searcher:
      name: single
      metric: validation_loss
      max_steps: 9 # 9 steps is ~ one epoch
      smaller_is_better: true
    entrypoint: model_def:MNistTrial

Rather than specifying the number of batches to train for directly, we instead specify the number of :ref:`steps <concept-step>`. By default, a step consists of 100 batches, so the config file above specifies that the model should be trained on 900 batches of data.

The ``entrypoint`` specifies the name of the trial class to use. This is useful if our model code contains more than one trial class. In this case, we use an entrypoint of ``model_def:MNistTrial`` because our trial class is named ``MNistTrial`` and it is defined in a Python file named ``model_def.py``.

For more information on experiment configuration, see the :ref:`experiment configuration reference <experiment-configuration>`.

Running an Experiment
---------------------

The Determined CLI can be used to create a new experiment, which will immediately start running on the cluster. To do this, we run:

.. code::

    det experiment create const.yaml .

Here, the first argument (``const.yaml``) is the name of the experiment configuration file and the second argument (``.``) is the location of the directory that contains our model definition files. You may need to configure the CLI with the network address where the Determined master is running, via the ``-m`` flag or the ``DET_MASTER`` environment variable. For more information, see the :ref:`CLI reference page <cli>`.

Once the experiment is started, you will see a notification:

.. code::

    Preparing files (.../mnist_pytorch) to send to master... 2.5KB and 4 files
    Created experiment xxx

Evaluating the Model
--------------------

Model evaluation is done automatically for you by Determined.
To access information on both training and validation performance,
simply go to the WebUI by entering the address of the Determined master
in your web browser.

Once you are on the Determined landing page, you can find your experiment
using the experiment's ID (``xxx`` in the example above) or description.
