.. meta::
   :description: Discover how to install and set up your Determined cluster locally, on AWS, on GCP, on Kubernetes, on Slurm or on premises.

Install and set up Determined using the cluster deployment guide for your environment.

.. include:: ../_shared/tip-keep-install-instructions.txt

.. note::

   To configure your cluster, visit :ref:`cluster-configuration`.

.. note::

   Administrators should first consult :ref:`advanced-setup-checklist` when setting up Determined
   for an organization.

.. note::

   **Initial Password**: When you deploy locally using ``det deploy local`` with ``master-up`` or
   ``cluster-up`` commands and no user accounts have been created yet, an initial password will be
   automatically generated and shown to the user (with the option to change it) if neither
   ``security.initial_user_password`` in ``master.yaml`` nor the ``--initial-user-password`` CLI
   flag is present.
