 Resource Pool
###############

Large-scale deep learning requires using different resources, including
computation resources, memory, network, and storage. Typically, we start
off prototyping our models with immediately available instance types
with few accelerators. Once our models are mature enough, we want to
scale up the training speed with larger instance types that have more
powerful accelerators and high-performing processors and more instances.
We also want to use instance types without expensive accelerators to run
TensorBoard or any bash commands to avoid wasting accelerators.

Determined provides the abstraction of physical resources for users to
choose on their tasks. We call this abstraction *resource pools*. We can
get the most value of our money by choosing different resource pools for
different goals.

Each resource pool is intended to map resources that are physically
close to each other. Each resource pool can be set to use one cloud
provider and one instance type and limited to have one region on AWS or
zone on GCP. Each resource pool handles scheduling and scaling
independently.
