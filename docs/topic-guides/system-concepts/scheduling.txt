 Scheduling
############

This topic guide covers the two different scheduling policies that are
supported in Determined. Administrators can configure the desired
scheduler in :ref:`master-configuration`. It is also possible to
configure different scheduling behavior for different :ref:`resource
pools <resource-pools>`.

Once the scheduling policy has been defined for the current master
and/or resource pool, the scheduling behavior of an individual task is
influenced by several task configuration values:

-  For the fair-share scheduler, ``resources.weight`` lets users set the
   resource demand of a task relative to other tasks.

-  For the priority scheduler, ``resources.priority`` lets users assign
   a priority order to tasks.

-  Regardless of the scheduler, ``searcher.max_concurrent_trials`` lets
   users cap the number of slots that an ``adaptive_asha``
   hyperparameter search experiment will request at any given time.

.. note::

   Zero-slot tasks (e.g., CPU-only notebooks, tensorboards) are
   scheduled independently of tasks that require slots (e.g.,
   experiments, GPU notebooks). The fair-share scheduler schedules
   zero-slot tasks on a FIFO basis. The priority scheduler schedules
   zero-slot tasks based on priority.

************
 Fair-Share
************

The master allocates cluster resources (*slots*) among the active
experiments using a weighted fair-share scheduling policy. Slots are
divided among the active experiments according to the *demand* (number
of desired concurrent tasks) of each experiment. For instance, in an
eight-GPU cluster running two experiments with demands of ten and
thirty, the scheduler assigns two slots and six slots respectively. As
new experiments become active or the resource demand of an active
experiment changes, the scheduler will adjust how slots are allocated to
experiments as appropriate.

The behavior of the fair-share scheduler can be modified by changing the
*weight* of a workload. A workload's demand for slots is multiplied by
the workload's weight for scheduling purposes; hence, a workload with a
higher weight will be assigned proportionally more resources than a
workload with lower weight. The default weight is ``1``. For example, in
the scenario above, if the weight of the first experiment is set to 3
and the weight of the second experiment is set to 1, each experiment
will be assigned four slots.

**********
 Priority
**********

The master allocates cluster resources (*slots*) to active tasks based
on their *priority*. While tasks of higher priority (lower priority
number) are pending, no lower priority tasks will be scheduled. For
instance, if tasks with priorities of five and forty-two are pending,
the latter will not be scheduled until the former has been. Tasks of
equal priority are scheduled in the order in which they were created.

By default, the priority scheduler does not use preemption. If
preemption is enabled (:ref:`master-configuration`), when a higher
priority task is pending and cannot be scheduled because no idle
resources are available, the scheduler will attempt to schedule it by
preempting lower priority tasks, starting with the task with the lowest
priority. When a trial is preempted, its state is checkpointed so that
the progress of the trial is not lost. Enabling preemption ensures that
cluster resources can be reallocated to high priority tasks more
promptly; however, preemption can also result in additional overhead due
to checkpointing low priority tasks, which might be expensive for some
models.

.. note::

   Notebooks, tensorboards, shells, and commands are not preemptible.
   These tasks will continue to occupy cluster resources until they
   complete or are terminated.

Here is an example of how the priority scheduler behaves with preemption
enabled:

#. User submits a priority 2 adaptive_asha experiment with
   max_concurrent_trials 20 and slots_per_trial 1. 8 trials run and
   utilize all 8 GPUs.

#. User submits a priority 1 distributed training experiment with
   slots_per_trial 4. 4 ASHA trials are preempted so the new distributed
   training experiment can run. Note that if preemption was not enabled,
   the new experiment would not get scheduled until the ASHA
   experiment's GPU demand becomes <= 4.

#. User starts a priority 3 notebook with resources.slots 1. The
   notebook has a lower priority than the two active experiments, so it
   will run as soon as the two active experiments collectively need <= 7
   GPUs.

#. ASHA and the distributed training experiment both complete, and the
   notebook task with priority 3 will run.

#. User submits a priority 1 distributed training experiment with
   slots_per_trial 8. Although this workload has a higher priority than
   the active notebook task, it cannot be scheduled because it requires
   8 slots, notebooks are not preemptible, and therefore only 7 slots
   are available.

#. User submits a priority 2 distributed training experiment with
   slots_per_trial 4. It will not be scheduled even though 7 slots are
   available, because it is behind a higher priority pending task.

#. The notebook is killed. The distributed training job that has
   priority 1 then starts running. Once that experiment is complete,
   distributed training experiment with priority 2 runs.

*******************************
 Gang Scheduling on Kubernetes
*******************************

By default, the Kubernetes scheduler does not perform gang scheduling or
support preemption of pods. While it does take pod priority into
account, it greedily schedules pods without consideration for the job
each pod belongs to. This can result in problematic behavior for deep
learning workloads, particularly for distributed training jobs that use
many GPUs. A distributed training job that uses multiple pods requires
all pods to be scheduled and running in order to make progress. Because
Kubernetes does not support gang scheduling by default, cluster
deadlocks can arise. For example, suppose that two experiments are
launched simultaneously that each require 16 GPUs on a cluster with only
16 GPUs. It is possible that Kubernetes will assign some GPUs to one
experiment and some GPUs to the other. Because neither experiment will
receive the resources it needs to begin executing, the system will wait
indefinitely.

One way Determined addresses these problems is through the use of the
`lightweight coscheduling plugin
<https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/tree/release-1.18/pkg/coscheduling>`__,
which extends the Kubernetes scheduler to support priority-based gang
scheduling. To implement gang scheduling, the coscheduling plugin will
not schedule a pod unless there are enough available resources to also
schedule the rest of the pods in the same job. To function, the plugin
requires special labels to be set that specify the number of nodes that
each job needs for execution. Determined automatically calculates and
sets these labels for GPU experiments that it launches.

The coscheduling plugin is in beta and is therefore not enabled by
default. To enable it, edit ``values.yaml`` in the Determined Helm chart
to set the ``defaultScheduler`` field to ``coscheduler``.

Importantly, the coscheduling plugin does not work with Kubernetes'
cluster autoscaling feature: static node pools must be used to achieve
gang scheduling. Also, while the plugin allocates resources to jobs
based on their priority, it does not support preemption. For example, if
the cluster is full of low priority jobs and a new high priority job is
submitted, the high priority job will not be scheduled until one of the
low priority jobs finishes. Lastly, Determined's capability to
automatically set pod labels is restricted to GPU experiments;
Determined does not currently set labels for CPU experiments or user
commands.

To enable gang scheduling with commands or CPU experiments, enable the
coscheduler in ``values.yaml`` and modify the experiment config to
contain the following:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
      pod_spec:
         metadata:
            labels:
               pod-group.scheduling.sigs.k8s.io/name: <unique task name>
               pod-group.scheduling.sigs.k8s.io/min-available: <# of GPUs required>
         spec:
            schedulerName: coscheduler

You can also use ``schedulerName: default-scheduler`` to use the default
Kubernetes scheduler.

.. _priority-scheduling-on-kubernetes:

***************************************************
 Priority Scheduling with Preemption on Kubernetes
***************************************************

Determined also makes available a priority scheduler with preemption
that extends the Kubernetes scheduler to support preemption. This plugin
will preempt existing pods if higher priority pods are submitted. This
plugin is also in beta and is not enabled by default. Similar to the
coscheduling plugin, it is enabled by setting the ``defaultScheduler``
field to ``preemption``. Autoscaling is not supported and Determined can
only automatically set labels for GPU experiments.

If using a cluster with tainted nodes or labels, users must specify the
tolerations or node selectors in the experiment config:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
      pod_spec:
         apiVersion: v1
         kind: Pod
         spec:
            priorityClassName: determined-medium-priority
            nodeSelector:
               key: value
            tolerations:
            -  key: "key1"
               operator: "Equal"
               value: "value"
               effect: "NoSchedule"

We recommend using both tolerations and node selectors to better
constrain where your experiments can run, especially on clusters that
contain multiple GPU types. Lastly, Determined provides low, medium, and
high priority classes by default, named ``determined-low-priority``,
``determined-medium-priority``, and ``determined-high-priority``. Users
may make their own priority classes for finer grained control if they
wish.
