 Scheduling
############

The master allocates cluster resources (slots) among the active
experiments using a fair-share scheduling policy. In other words, slots
are divided among the active experiments according to the *demand*
(number of desired concurrent tasks) of each experiment. For instance,
in an eight-GPU cluster running two experiments with demands of three
and six, the scheduler assigns three slots and five slots respectively.
As new experiments become active or the resource demand of an active
experiment changes, the scheduler will adjust how slots are allocated to
experiments as appropriate.

Scheduling behavior can be configured via the ``resources`` section of
the experiment config file; see :ref:`experiment-configuration` for
details.
