 Transport Layer Security
##########################

**Transport Layer Security** (TLS) is a protocol for secure network
communication. TLS prevents the data being transmitted from being
modified or read while it is in transit and allows clients to verify the
identity of the server (in this case, the Determined master). Determined
can be configured to use TLS for all connections made to the master.
That means that all CLI and WebUI connections will be secured by TLS, as
well as connections from agents and tasks to the master. Communication
between agents that occur as part of :ref:`distributed training
<multi-gpu-training>` will not use TLS, nor will proxied connections
from the master to a :ref:`TensorBoard <how-to-tensorboard>` or
:ref:`notebook <how-to-notebooks>` instance.

*****************
 Configuring TLS
*****************

Master
======

In order to :ref:`configure the master <master-configuration>` to use
TLS, set the ``security.tls.cert`` and ``security.tls.key`` options to
paths to a TLS certificate file and key file.

When TLS is in use, the master will listen on TCP port 8443 by default,
rather than 8080.

.. note::

   If the master's certificate is not signed by a well-known CA, then
   the configured certificate file must contain a full certificate chain
   that goes all the way to a root certificate.

Agents
======

When the Determined master is using TLS, set the
``security.tls.enabled`` :ref:`agent configuration option
<agent-configuration>` to ``true``. If the master's certificate is
signed by a well-known CA, then no other TLS-specific configuration is
necessary. Otherwise, for the best security, place the master's
certificate file somewhere accessible to the agent and set the agent's
``security.tls.master_cert`` option to the path to that file. For a more
convenient but less secure setup, instead set the
``security.tls.skip_verify`` option to ``true``. With the latter
configuration, the agent will be unable to verify the identity of the
master, but the data sent over the connection will still be protected by
TLS.

If the master's certificate does not contain the address that the agent
is using to connect to the master (but is otherwise valid), set the
``security.tls.master_cert_name`` option to one of the addresses in the
certificate. For example, the master's certificate may contain a DNS
hostname corresponding to the public IP address of the master, while the
agent connects to the master using its private IP address to prevent
traffic from being routed over the public Internet. In that case, the
option should be set to the DNS name contained in the certificate.

When :ref:`dynamic agents <elastic-infra-index>` and TLS are both in
use, the dynamic agents that the master creates will automatically be
configured to connect securely to the master over TLS.

CLI
===

In order to use TLS, the CLI must be configured with a master address
starting with ``https://`` using either the ``-m`` flag or
``DET_MASTER`` environment variable.

If the master's certificate is signed by a well-known CA, then the
connection should proceed immediately. If not, the CLI will indicate on
the first connection that the master is presenting an untrusted
certificate and display a hash of the certificate. You may wish to
confirm the hash with your system administrator; in any case, if you
confirm the connection to the master, the certificate will be stored on
the computer where the CLI is being run and future connections to the
master will be made without confirmation.

Tasks
=====

Once the master and agent are configured to use TLS, no further
configuration is required for tasks that are run in the cluster. In
shells and notebooks, the Determined :ref:`Python libraries
<experimental>` will automatically make connections to the master using
TLS with the appropriate certificate.
