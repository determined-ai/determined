 Best Practices for Model Definitions
######################################

The deep learning software ecosystem is still in its early stages and
changing rapidly. Due to the bleeding-edge nature of this field, many
code-bases initially optimize for quick iteration and exploration over
good software engineering practices. The Determined platform is designed
to bring workflows from research to production and our APIs are designed
with this goal in mind. This topic guide discusses some of the highly
recommended best practices to follow when writing model definitions.

To learn more about the basics of model definitions, see
:ref:`model-definitions`.

**********************************
 Separate Configuration from Code
**********************************

Determined encourages a clean separation of code from configuration via
the :ref:`experiment configuration <experiment-configuration>`.
Structured properties like the ``searcher``, ``hyperparameters``,
``optimizations``, and ``resources`` will be stored in the database and
browsable via our WebUI, improving the **tracking** and
**collaboration** capabilities of the platform.

Do:

-  Move any hardcoded scalar values to the :ref:`hyperparameters
   <experiment-configuration_hyperparameters>` or :ref:`data
   <experiment-config-data>` fields in the experiment configuration. Use
   :func:`context.get_hparam() <determined.TrialContext.get_hparam>` or
   :func:`context.get_data_config()
   <determined.TrialContext.get_data_config>` to reference them in code.

-  Move any hardcoded filesystem paths (e.g., ``/data/train.csv``) to
   the ``data`` field of the experiment configuration. Use
   ``context.get_data_config()`` to reference them in code.

Do not:

-  Use global variables in your model definition; consider moving them
   to the experiment configuration.

*************************
 Understand Dependencies
*************************

Determined encourages tracking the dependencies associated with every
workflow via the :ref:`environment <experiment-configuration>` field.
Understanding and standardizing the environment you use to execute
Python in your development environment will pay off dividends in
**portability**, allowing you to flexibly move between local, cloud, and
on-premise cluster environments.

Do:

-  Ramp up quickly by using our :ref:`default environment Docker image
   <default-environment>`, optionally specifying additional PyPI
   dependencies by using ``pip install`` in ``startup-hook.sh``.

-  As your dependencies increase in complexity, invest in :ref:`building
   and using a custom Docker image <custom-env>` that meets your needs.

-  Pin Python package dependencies to specific versions (e.g.,
   ``<package>==<version>``) in build tools.

Do not:

-  Modify the ``PYTHONPATH`` or ``PATH`` environment variables to import
   libraries by circumventing the Python packaging system.

**********************
 Master the Framework
**********************

-  :ref:`TensorFlow Estimator <estimator-trial>`
-  :ref:`TensorFlow Keras <tf-keras-trial>`
-  :ref:`PyTorch <pytorch-trial>`

Determined APIs are designed to conform to the best practices of the
frameworks that we support. Standardizing on the best practices of these
frameworks will result in a smoother Determined user experience.

Do:

-  Stay up to date with the latest framework version.
-  Follow the best practices and examples laid out by the framework
   documentation.

Do not:

-  Use deprecated or unsupported interfaces in application frameworks.
-  Use a custom forked version of the application framework. Determined
   will only support the official releases of frameworks.

**************************
 Tips for Determined APIs
**************************

Do:

-  Use the :ref:`model-debug` guide if you run into issues with your
   Trial class.

-  Use framework abstractions to implement learning rate scheduling
   instead of directly changing the learning rate. See
   `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule
   <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/schedules/LearningRateSchedule>`__
   and :class:`determined.pytorch.LRScheduler` as examples.

-  For code that needs to download artifacts (e.g., data,
   configurations, pretrained weights), download to a
   `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory
   <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html>`__ unique to the
   Python process. This will avoid race conditions when using
   :ref:`distributed training <multi-gpu-training>`, in which Determined
   executes multiple Python processes in the same task container.

Do not:

-  Use instance attributes on a trial class to save any state over time
   (e.g., storing metric history in a ``self`` attribute). The ``Trial``
   instance will only save and restore model weights and optimizer state
   over time; ``self`` attributes may be reset to their initial state at
   any time if the Determined cluster reschedules the trial to another
   task container.
