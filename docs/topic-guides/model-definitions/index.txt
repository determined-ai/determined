 Model Definitions
###################

The model definition is the interface between Determined and the user's
application framework (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow), in terms of loading
training data, describing a model architecture, and specifying the
underlying iterative optimization training algorithms.

There interface you can use to write model definition is the Trial API.
With the :ref:`model-definitions_trial-api`, developers expose the
components of a model definition to Determinedâ€™s training loop
implementation.

The command line interface and Python SDK support the Trial API.

To read more about the Trial API, see:

-  :ref:`pytorch-trial`
-  :ref:`tf-keras-trial`
