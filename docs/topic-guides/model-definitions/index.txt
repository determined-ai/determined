 Model Definitions
###################

The model definition is the interface between Determined and the user's
application framework (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow), in terms of loading
training data, describing a model architecture, and specifying the
underlying iterative optimization training algorithms.

Model definitions are written using the Trial API, which is an interface
provided by Determined. With the :ref:`Trial API
<model-definitions_trial-api>`, developers expose the components of a
model definition to Determined's training loop implementation.

To read more about the Trial API, see:

-  :ref:`model-definitions_trial-api`
-  :ref:`pytorch-trial`
-  :ref:`tf-keras-trial`
-  :ref:`estimator-trial`

For examples of how to adapt existing model code to use the Trial APIs,
see the :ref:`tf.keras tutorial <tf-mnist-tutorial>` and the
:ref:`PyTorch tutorial <pytorch-mnist-tutorial>`, respectively.
