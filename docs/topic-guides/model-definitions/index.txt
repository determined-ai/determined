Model Definitions
=================

The model definition is the interface between Determined and the user's
application framework (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow), in terms of loading
training data, describing a model architecture, and specifying the
underlying iterative optimization training algorithms.

There are two interfaces you can use to write model definitions: Native and
Trial. With the :ref:`model-definitions_native-api` (TensorFlow Keras and
Estimators), developers instrument training scripts adhering to these
frameworks' native patterns including their training loops. With the
:ref:`model-definitions_trial-api`, developers expose the components of a model
definition to Determinedâ€™s training loop implementation.

The Python SDK supports the Native API for TF Keras and Estimators. The command
line interface and Python SDK support the Trial API.

To read more about the Native API, see:

-  :ref:`tutorials_native-api`
-  :ref:`model-definitions_native-api`

To read more about the Trial API, see:

-  :ref:`model-definitions_trial-api`
-  :ref:`pytorch-trial`
-  :ref:`tf-keras-trial`
-  :ref:`estimator-trial`
