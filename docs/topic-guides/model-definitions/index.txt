 Model Definitions
###################

The model definition is the interface between Determined and the user's application framework (e.g.,
Keras, TensorFlow), in terms of loading training data, describing a model architecture, and
specifying the underlying iterative optimization training algorithms.

Model definitions are written using the Trial API, which is an interface provided by Determined.
With the :ref:`Trial API <model-definitions_trial-api>`, developers expose the components of a model
definition to Determined's training loop implementation.

To read more about the Trial API, see:

-  :ref:`model-definitions_trial-api`
-  :ref:`pytorch-trial`
-  :ref:`tf-keras-trial`
-  :ref:`estimator-trial`

For examples of how to adapt existing model code to use the Trial APIs, see the :ref:`tf.keras
tutorial <tf-mnist-tutorial>` and the :ref:`PyTorch tutorial <pytorch-mnist-tutorial>`,
respectively.
