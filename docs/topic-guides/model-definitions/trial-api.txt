*****************************
 Model Definition Interfaces
*****************************

To create a Trial API model definition, we should implement the Trial
interface provided by Determined. This interface returns information
about the machine learning task the user wants to perform, like the
model architecture to use or the validation metrics that should be
computed.

Determined provides versions of the Trial interface for each of the
application frameworks it supports:

-  :ref:`pytorch-trial`
-  :ref:`tf-keras-trial`
-  :ref:`estimator-trial`

If you hit any issues creating your Trial API model definition, you can
visit :ref:`model-debug`. It may also be useful for writing your first
trial, as it has a framework for incrementally testing each of the
features you will need in a successful Trial definition.

**********************************
 Create an Experiment via the CLI
**********************************

A user can submit an experiment via the ``det experiment create`` CLI
command:

.. code::

   $ det experiment create <YAML config file> <context directory>

The context directory of Python files that contain the Trial API
implementation should include an accompanying ``entrypoint`` that
specifies from where to load a trial class. The entrypoint specification
is expected to take the form:

.. code::

   <module>:<object reference>

``<module>`` specifies the module containing the trial class within the
model definition, relative to the root. It may be an empty string if the
model definition is a `Python package
<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages>`_ and the
trial class is exposed in the top-level ``__init__.py`` file.

``<object reference>`` specifies the naming of the trial class within
the module. It may be a nested object delimited by dots.

Examples:

#. ``:MNistTrial`` expects an ``MNistTrial`` class that is exposed in a
   ``__init__.py`` file at the top level of the context directory.

#. ``model_def:CIFAR10Trial`` expects a ``CIFAR10Trial`` class that is
   defined in a file ``model_def.py`` at the top level of the context
   directory.

#. ``determined_lib.trial:trial_classes.NestedTrial`` expects a
   ``NestedTrial`` class that is an attribute of ``trial_classes``,
   where ``trial_classes`` is defined in a file
   ``determined_lib/trial.py``.

Note that this follows the `Entry points specification defined in the
Python Packaging User Guide
<https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/>`_ with a
single difference: the name of the context directory is prefixed to
``<module>``, or used as the module if ``<module>`` is empty.

Since project directories might include large artifacts that should not
be packaged as part of the model definition (e.g., data sets or compiled
binaries), users can optionally include a ``.detignore`` file at the top
level that specifies file paths to be omitted from the model definition.
The ``.detignore`` file uses the same syntax as `.gitignore
<https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>`__. Note that byte-compiled Python
files (e.g., ``.pyc`` files or ``__pycache__`` directories) are always
ignored.
