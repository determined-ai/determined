 User Interfaces

*******
 WebUI
*******

The WebUI allows users to create and monitor the progress of
experiments. It is accessible by visiting ``http://master-addr:8080``,
where ``master-addr`` is the hostname or IP address where the Determined
master is running.

*****
 CLI
*****

Users can also interact with Determined using a command-line interface.
The CLI is distributed as a Python wheel package; once the wheel has
been installed (see :ref:`install-cli` for details), the CLI can be used
via the ``det`` command.

The CLI should be installed on any machine where a user would like to
access Determined. The ``-m`` or ``--master`` flag determines the
network address of the Determined master that the CLI connects to. If
this flag is not specified, the value of the ``DET_MASTER`` environment
variable is used; if that environment variable is not set, the default
address is ``localhost``. The master address can be specified in three
different formats:

-  ``example.org:port`` (if ``port`` is omitted, it defaults to
   ``8080``)
-  ``http://example.org:port`` (if ``port`` is omitted, it defaults to
   ``80``)
-  ``https://example.org:port`` (if ``port`` is omitted, it defaults to
   ``443``)

Examples:

.. code:: bash

   # Connect to localhost, port 8080.
   $ det experiment list

   # Connect to example.org, port 8888.
   $ det -m example.org:8888 e list

   # Connect to example.org, port 80.
   $ det -m http://example.org e list

   # Connect to example.org, port 443.
   $ det -m https://example.org e list

   # Connect to example.org, port 8080.
   $ det -m example.org e list

   # Set default Determined master address to example.org, port 8888.
   $ export DET_MASTER="example.org:8888"

CLI subcommands usually follow a ``<noun> <verb>`` form, similar to the
paradigm of `ip <http://www.policyrouting.org/iproute2.doc.html>`__.
Certain abbreviations are supported, and a missing verb is the same as
``list``, when possible.

For example, the different commands within each of the blocks below all
do the same thing:

.. code:: bash

   # List all experiments.
   $ det experiment list
   $ det exp list
   $ det e list
   $ det e

.. code:: bash

   # List all agents.
   $ det agent list
   $ det a list
   $ det a

.. code:: bash

   # List all slots.
   $ det slot list
   $ det slot
   $ det s

For a complete description of the available nouns and abbreviations, see
the output of ``det help``. Each noun also provides a ``help`` verb that
describes the possible verbs for that noun.
