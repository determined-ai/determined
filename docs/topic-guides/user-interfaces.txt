*******
 WebUI
*******

The WebUI allows users to create and monitor the progress of experiments. It is accessible by
visiting ``http://master-addr:8080``, where ``master-addr`` is the hostname or IP address where the
Determined master is running.

*****
 CLI
*****

Users can also interact with Determined using a command-line interface. The CLI is distributed as a
Python wheel package; once the wheel has been installed (see :ref:`install-cli` for details), the
CLI can be used via the ``det`` command.

The CLI should be installed on any machine where a user would like to access Determined. The ``-m``
or ``--master`` flag determines the network address of the Determined master that the CLI connects
to. If this flag is not specified, the value of the ``DET_MASTER`` environment variable is used; if
that environment variable is not set, the default address is ``localhost``. The master address can
be specified in three different formats:

-  ``example.org:port`` (if ``port`` is omitted, it defaults to ``8080``)
-  ``http://example.org:port`` (if ``port`` is omitted, it defaults to ``80``)
-  ``https://example.org:port`` (if ``port`` is omitted, it defaults to ``443``)

Examples:

.. code:: bash

   # Connect to localhost, port 8080.
   $ det experiment list

   # Connect to example.org, port 8888.
   $ det -m example.org:8888 e list

   # Connect to example.org, port 80.
   $ det -m http://example.org e list

   # Connect to example.org, port 443.
   $ det -m https://example.org e list

   # Connect to example.org, port 8080.
   $ det -m example.org e list

   # Set default Determined master address to example.org, port 8888.
   $ export DET_MASTER="example.org:8888"

CLI subcommands usually follow a ``<noun> <verb>`` form, similar to the paradigm of `ip
<http://www.policyrouting.org/iproute2.doc.html>`__. Certain abbreviations are supported, and a
missing verb is the same as ``list``, when possible.

For example, the different commands within each of the blocks below all do the same thing:

.. code:: bash

   # List all experiments.
   $ det experiment list
   $ det exp list
   $ det e list
   $ det e

.. code:: bash

   # List all agents.
   $ det agent list
   $ det a list
   $ det a

.. code:: bash

   # List all slots.
   $ det slot list
   $ det slot
   $ det s

For a complete description of the available nouns and abbreviations, see the output of ``det help``.
Each noun also provides a ``help`` verb that describes the possible verbs for that noun.
