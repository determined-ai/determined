Specifying Custom Pod Specs
===========================

As described in the :ref:`determined-on-kubernetes` guide, when tasks (e.g., experiments, notebooks) are started
in a Determined cluster running on Kubernetes, the Determined master launches pods to execute these tasks. In this guide, we
focus on how users can customize these pods by providing their own pod specs. Common use cases include but
are not limited to: assigning pods to specific nodes, specifying additional volume mounts, attaching permissions.
Please note that configuring pod specs is not required to use Determined on kubernetes.

In this topic guide, we will cover:

#. The different ways to configure custom pod specs.
#. Supported pod spec fields.
#. How to configuring default pod specs.
#. How to configuring per-task pods specs.


Ways to Configure Pod Specs
---------------------------

Determined provides two ways to configure pod specs. Users can configure default pod specs for all GPU and CPU tasks.
It is also possible configure pod specs for individual tasks. If a custom pod spec is specified for a
task, it overrides the default pod spec of one is configured.


Supported Pod Spec Fields
-------------------------

This section describes which fields users can and can't configure when specifying custom `pod specs <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#pod-v1-core>`__.

Determined does not currently support configuring:

- Pod Name - Determined automatically assigns a name for every pod that is created.
- Pod Namespace - Determined launches all tasks in the Namespace in which the Determined master is running.
- Host Networking - This must be configured via the :ref:`master-configuration`.
- Init Containers - Determined does not currently support init containers.

Additionally users are allowed to specify the spec for exactly one container within the pod. The specs
of this container will be applied to the container that executes the task launched by Determined.
For the container spec Determined does not currently support configuring:

- Container Name - Determined automatically assigns this.
- Container Image - Please see :ref:`container-images` for how to specify custom docker images.
- Container Command.
- Container Args.
- Container WorkingDir - Determined sets the working directory to be ``/run/determined/workdir``.
- Container Ports.
- Container EnvFrom.
- Container Env - Please see :ref:`environment-variables` for how to set environment variables.
- Container LivelinessProbe.
- Container ReadinessProbe.
- Container StartupProbe.
- Container Lifecycle.
- Container TerminationMessagePath.
- Container TerminationMessagePolicy.
- Container ImagePullPolicy - Please see :ref:`force_pull_image <exp-environment-image>` for how to configure. Defaults to ``PullIfNotPresent``.
- Container SecurityContext.


Configuring Default Pod Specs
-----------------------------

Defining default pod specs must be done when :ref:`installing or updating <install-on-kubernetes>` Determined.
The default pod specs are configured in ``values.yaml`` of the :ref:`Determined helm chart <helm-config>` under
``taskContainerDefaults.cpuPodSpec`` and ``taskContainerDefaults.gpuPodSpec``. The ``gpuPodSpec`` is applied to
all tasks that use GPUs (e.g., experiments, notebooks). ``cpuPodSpec`` is applied to all tasks that use only CPUs
(e.g, TensorBoards, cpu only notebooks).

Example of configuring default pod specs:

.. code:: yaml

    taskContainerDefaults:
      cpuPodSpec:
        metadata:
          labels:
            customLabel: cpu-label
        spec:
          containers:
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /example-data
              name: example-volume
          volumes:
            - name: example-volume
              hostPath:
                path: /data
      gpuPodSpec:
        metadata:
          labels:
            customLabel: gpu-label
        spec:
          containers:
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /example-data
              name: example-volume
          volumes:
            - name: example-volume
              hostPath:
                path: /data


Configuring Per Task Pod Specs
------------------------------

In addition to default pod specs, it is also possible to configure custom pod specs for individual tasks. When defining
a custom pod spec for a task, it will overwrite the default pod spec if one is defined. Pod specs for individual tasks
can be configured under ``environment`` in the :ref:`experiment config <exp-environment>`.

Example of configuring a pod spec for an individual task:

.. code:: yaml

    environment:
      pod_spec:
        metadata:
          labels:
            customLabel: task-specific-label
