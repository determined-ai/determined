 Elasticsearch-backed logging

This guide covers the limitations of the default logging backend, as a
guideline on when to migrate to Elasticsearch, and some tips for how to
tune Elasticsearch to work best with Determined.

`Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch>`__ is a
search engine commonly used for storing application logs for search and
analytics. Determined supports using Elasticsearch as the storage
backend for trial logs. Configuring Determined to use Elasticsearch is
simple; however, managing an Elasticsearch cluster at scale is an
involved task, so this guide is recommended for users who have hit the
limitations of the default logging backend.

Using the default logging backend, with a standard deployment using
``det-deploy``, the cluster can ingest logs about as fast as Postgres
can persist them. For example, with ``det-deploy aws`` using Aurora
Serverless with 2 capacity units, ingestion speed maxes out around 10-15
MB/s (where the database's CPU hits ~90%). To get a little more mileage
from the default, we recommend increasing the capacity of the database.
At a certain point, the master instance itself will become the
bottleneck, since it has limited incoming network bandwidth for HTTP
requests delivering logs and limited resources to process them. The
master instance size can be increased, but vertical scaling is likely to
be limited to a log throughput of around hundreds of megabytes per
second; we recommend moving to Elasticsearch to get past that limit.

Determined offers some additional recommendations for the Elasticsearch
cluster configuration based on how the cluster will be used:

-  Tune the default shards per index to your expected throughput (or use
   `index templates
   <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/index-templates.html>`__).
   Determined ships logs in Logstash format rolling over to a new index
   each day. Depending on your log volume, the default number of shards
   could be too high or too low. The general rule of thumb is not to
   exceed 50 GB per shard while minimizing the number of shards per
   index. For high-utilization clusters, this may entail increasing the
   shards per index and rotating indices older than a few months out of
   the cluster periodically, to avoid the overhead accumulated from
   having too many shards. A more in-depth guide can be found `here
   <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/size-your-shards.html>`__.

-  Though it may increase latency for end users, increasing the `refresh
   interval
   <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/tune-for-indexing-speed.html#_unset_or_increase_the_refresh_interval>`__
   may help increase total throughput.

-  Apply the following `index template
   <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates-v1.html>`__
   to optimize the mappings in Determined log indices for ingest speed.
   This turns off analysis and in some cases indexing on properties for
   which Determined does not use these features.
