#######################################
 SCIM Integration (Enterprise Edition)
#######################################

Determined EE provides a System for Cross-domain Identity Management
(SCIM) integration to allow administrators to easily and securely
provision users and groups through their standard identity provider
(IdP). Currently, the only officially supported provider is Okta;
however, Determined implements a minimal working subset of the protocol
as specified by :RFC:`7644` and is expected to work with most IdPs that
adhere to this RFC.

************************
 Configuring Determined
************************

Determined only requires you to enable SCIM and set your authentication
mode and any necessary credentials.

**********************
 Configuring your IdP
**********************

When configuring your IdP to automatically push users and groups to
Determined, you will need to enable SCIM for Determined in your IdP and
provide it with some information about Determined's SCIM API. This
includes the SCIM connector base URL, the unique ID for users that are
provisioned, which provisioning actions should be supported, and the
authentication mode to use.

*************************
 Example Setup with Okta
*************************

In this example, we assume the Determined master will run at
``https://determined.example.com`` and that we are using the basic
authentication mode. For more information on configuring Determined to
use the OAuth2 authentication mode, see the :ref:`OAuth <oauth>` topic
guide.

First, in Okta, you'll need to create a new Okta application for
Determined or alter your existing one. Under ``Determined -> General ->
App Settings -> Provisioning``, select the ``SCIM`` radio button. A new
tab ``Determined -> Provisioning`` should appear---navigate to its
``Integration`` tab and specify the following configurations for the
integration:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   -  -  Field
      -  Example Value
   -  -  SCIM connector base URL
      -  ``https://determined.example.com/scim/v2``
   -  -  Unique identifier for users
      -  ``userName``
   -  -  Supported provisioning actions
      -  Check all boxes your organization wants to support
   -  -  Authentication Mode
      -  Basic Auth
   -  -  Username
      -  ``determined``
   -  -  Password
      -  ``password``

.. note::

   The username and password shown here are arbitrary and only expected
   to match the values provided to the ``scim.auth`` configuration
   section.

Then navigate to ``Determined -> Provisioning -> To App`` and enable the
provisioning features your organization wants to use with Okta.

To configure Determined for this integration, update the :ref:`master
configuration <master-configuration>` to provide the client's
credentials and enable the SCIM server.

.. code:: yaml

   scim:
     enabled: true
     auth:
       type: basic
       username: "determined"
       password: "password"
