Dynamic Agents Overview
=======================

When running Determined with Dynamic Agents, the Determined master dynamically
provisions and terminates cloud instances to meet the needs of the
cluster.

-  Provisioning new Determined agents is quick: we make API calls to the cloud
   provider to provision new instances within a few seconds of new tasks
   arriving. Within a few minutes new instances will have registered
   themselves with the Determined master and start running tasks.
-  When Determined agents become idle, we give them a five minute grace period
   before terminating the instances. This grace period provides for a
   short interval of time for the Determined agent instance to receive new
   tasks.
