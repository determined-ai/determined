 Overall Vision
****************

Deep learning practitioners come from a variety of disciplines. Depending on their background, some
practitioners have strong foundations in engineering, while others focus on statistics and domain
expertise. Determined AI is a deep learning training platform that simplifies infrastructure
management for domain experts while enabling configuration-based deep learning functionality that is
generally inconvenient to implement for engineering-oriented practitioners.

*****************
 Core Components
*****************

Many current systems are point solutions for specific problems in deep learning, so combining the
systems is tough and inefficient. Determined's cohesive end-to-end training platform provides
best-in-class functionality for deep learning model training, with a suite of benefits, including:

-  **Cluster management**: Automatically manage accelerators (e.g., GPUs) on-premise or in cloud
   VMs, using your own environment that automatically scales for your on-demand workloads.
   Determined runs in either AWS or GCP, so you can switch easily as your needs require.

-  **Containerization**: Develop and train models in customizable containers, which enable simple
   and consistent dependency management throughout the model development lifecycle.

-  **Cluster-backed notebooks**: Experiment directly in a cluster-backed Jupyter notebook, so you
   can leverage your shared cluster accelerators in a more versatile notebook environment.

-  **Experiment collaboration**: Automatically track the configuration and environment for each of
   your experiments, facilitating reproducibility and collaboration among teams.

-  **Fault tolerance**: Models are checkpointed throughout the training process and can be restarted
   from the latest checkpoint automatically if there are any hardware or system issues in the
   cluster.

-  **Automated model tuning**: Optimize models by searching through conventional hyperparameters or
   macro-architectures, using a variety of search algorithms including our adaptive search.
   Hyperparameter searches are automatically parallelized across the accelerators in your cluster.

-  **Distributed training**: Easily distribute model training across your cluster so you can
   experiment more efficiently and earlier in your model development. Determined leverages
   synchronous, data-parallel distributed training, with key performance optimizations over other
   available options.

-  **Broad framework support**: Leverage these capabilities using any of the leading machine
   learning frameworks without having to manage a different cluster for each. Different frameworks
   for different models can be used without worrying about future lock-in.
