Benefits of Determined
----------------------

Overall Vision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deep learning practitioners come from a variety of disciplines. Depending on their background, some practitioners have strong foundations in engineering, while others focus on statistics and domain expertise. Determined AI is a deep learning training platform that simplifies infrastructure management for domain experts while enabling configuration-based deep learning functionality that is generally inconvenient to implement for engineering-oriented practitioners.

Core Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many current systems are point solutions for specific problems in deep learning, so combining the systems is tough and inefficient. Determined's cohesive end-to-end training platform provides best-in-class functionality for deep learning model training, with a suite of benefits, including:

- **Cluster management**: Automatically manage accelerators (e.g., GPUs) on-premise or in cloud VMs, using your own environment that automatically scales for your on-demand workloads. Determined runs in either AWS or GCP, so you can switch easily as your needs require.
- **Containerization**: Develop and train models in customizable containers, which enable simple and consistent dependency management throughout the model development lifecycle.
- **Cluster-backed notebooks**: Experiment directly in a cluster-backed Jupyter notebook, so you can leverage your shared cluster accelerators in a more versatile notebook environment.
- **Experiment collaboration**: Automatically track the configuration and environment for each of your experiments, facilitating reproducibility and collaboration among teams.
- **Fault tolerance**: Models are checkpointed throughout the training process and can be restarted from the latest checkpoint automatically if there are any hardware or system issues in the cluster.
- **Automated model tuning**: Optimize models by searching through conventional hyperparameters or macro-architectures, using a variety of search algorithms including our adaptive search. Hyperparameter searches are automatically parallelized across the accelerators in your cluster.
- **Distributed training**: Easily distribute model training across your cluster so you can experiment more efficiently and earlier in your model development. Determined leverages synchronous, data-parallel distributed training, with key performance optimizations over other available options.
- **Broad framework support**: Leverage these capabilities using any of the leading machine learning frameworks without having to manage a different cluster for each. Different frameworks for different models can be used without worrying about future lock-in.
