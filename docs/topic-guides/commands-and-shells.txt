 Commands and Shells
#####################

In addition to structured model training workloads, which are handled
using :ref:`experiments <experiment-lifecycle>`, Determined also
supports more free-form tasks using *commands* and *shells*. Commands
and shells enable developers to use a Determined cluster and its GPUs
without having to write code conforming to the trial APIs. Commands are
useful for running existing code in a batch manner; shells provide
access to the cluster in the form of interactive `SSH
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)>`_ sessions.

This document provides an overview of the most common CLI commands
related to shells and commands; see :ref:`cli` for full documentation.

*****************
 Getting Started
*****************

Commands
========

Command-related CLI commands start with ``det command`` (which can be
abbreviated to ``det cmd``). The main subcommand is ``det cmd run``,
which runs a command in the cluster and streams its output. For example,
the following CLI command uses ``nvidia-smi`` to display information
about the GPUs available to tasks in the container:

.. code::

   det cmd run nvidia-smi

More complex commands including shell constructs can be run as well, as
long as they are quoted to prevent interpretation by the local shell:

.. code::

   det cmd run 'for x in a b c; do echo $x; done'

``det cmd run`` will stream output from the command until it finishes,
but the command will continue executing and occupying cluster resources
even if the CLI is interrupted or killed (e.g., due to Control-C being
pressed). In order to stop the command or view further output from it,
you'll need its UUID, which can be obtained from the output of either
the original ``det cmd run`` or ``det cmd list``. Once you have the
UUID, run ``det cmd logs <UUID>`` to view a snapshot of logs, ``det cmd
logs -f <UUID>`` to view the current logs and continue streaming future
output, or ``det cmd kill <UUID>`` to stop the command.

Shells
======

Shell-related CLI commands start with ``det shell``. To start a
persistent SSH server container in the Determined cluster and connect an
interactive session to it, use ``det shell start``:

.. code::

   det shell start

After starting a server with ``det shell start``, you can make another
independent connection to the same server by running ``det shell open
<UUID>``. The UUID can be obtained from the output of either the
original ``det shell start`` command or ``det shell list``:

.. code::

   $ det shell list
    Id                                   | Owner      | Description                  | State   | Exit Status
   --------------------------------------+------------+------------------------------+---------+---------------
    d75c3908-fb11-4fa5-852c-4c32ed30703b | determined | Shell (annually-alert-crane) | RUNNING | N/A
   $ det shell open d75c3908-fb11-4fa5-852c-4c32ed30703b

Optionally, you can provide extra options to pass to the SSH client when
using ``det shell start`` or ``det shell open`` by including them after
``--``. For example, this command will start a new shell and forward a
port from the local machine to the container:

.. code::

   det shell start -- -L8080:localhost:8080

In order to stop the SSH server container and free up cluster resources,
run ``det shell kill <UUID>``.

*********************
 Context Directories
*********************

Commands and shells become much more powerful with the use of the ``-c
<directory>`` option, which tells Determined to transfer files from a
directory on the local machine (the "context directory") to the
container. The contents of the context directory are placed into the
directory ``/run/determined/workdir`` within the container before the
command or shell starts running. ``/run/determined/workdir`` is also the
initial working directory for commands, so they can easily access files
from the context using relative paths.

.. code::

   $ mkdir context
   $ echo 'print("hello world")' > context/run.py
   $ det cmd run -c context python run.py

The total size of the files in the context directory must be less than
95 MB. Larger files, such as datasets, must be mounted into the
container (see next section), downloaded after the container starts, or
included in a :ref:`custom Docker image <custom-docker-images>`.

************************
 Advanced Configuration
************************

:ref:`Additional configuration settings
<command-notebook-configuration>` for both commands and shells can be
set using the ``--config`` and ``--config-file`` options. Commonly
useful settings include:

-  ``bind_mounts``: Specifies directories to be bind-mounted into the
   container from the host machine. (Due to the structured values
   required for this setting, it needs to be specified in a config
   file.)

-  ``resources.slots``: Specifies the number of slots the container will
   have access to. (Distributed commands and shells are not supported;
   all slots will be on one machine and attempting to use more slots
   than are available on one machine will prevent the container from
   being scheduled.)

-  ``environment.image``: Specifies a custom Docker image to use for the
   container.

-  ``description``: Specifies a description for the command or shell to
   distinguish it from others.
