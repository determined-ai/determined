Exporting Trained Models and Checkpoints
----------------------------------------

After training a model that achieves satisfactory performance, it is
often important to export the trained model for use outside Determined (e.g.,
to deploy the model as part of a web service or on an embedded device).
In the current version of Determined, exporting models is supported by copying
the **checkpoints** that are automatically created during the training
process.

A checkpoint consists of the model architecture and the values of the
model's parameters (i.e., weights) and hyperparameters. When using a
stateful optimizer during training, checkpoints will also consist of
optimizer state (i.e., learning rate). The exact checkpoint format
depends on the application framework being used:

-  TensorFlow trials are checkpointed using the
   `SavedModel <https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/saved_model#structure_of_a_savedmodel_directory>`__
   format. Please consult the TensorFlow documentation to restore models
   from the SavedModel format.
-  Keras trials are checkpointed as an HDF5 file with the weights of a
   model and a JSON file describing the model's architecture. When using
   a stateful optimization method, the optimizer state is also saved in
   a separate HDF5 file. To restore the architecture and/or weights of a
   Keras trial checkpoint, use the
   `keras.models.model_from_json() <https://keras.io/models/about-keras-models/>`__
   and
   `model.load_weights() <https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model>`__
   Keras APIs, respectively. Optimizer state is currently saved in a
   custom experimental format---to restore it outside of Determined, please
   contact the Determined AI team for a consultation.
-  TF Keras trials are checkpointed to a file named ``determined-keras-model``
   using ``tf.keras.models.save_model``. You can learn more from the `TF
   Keras
   docs <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/keras/models/save_model>`__.

.. _pytorch-checkpoints:

-  PyTorch trials are checkpointed as a checkpoint.pt file. This file is
   created very similar to what is described in the `PyTorch
   documentation <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#saving-loading-a-general-checkpoint-for-inference-and-or-resuming-training>`__.
   Instead of the fields in the documentation linked above, there are
   three fields for the dictionary that is saved by Determined:
   "model_state_dict", "optimizer_state_dict", and "hparams", which are
   the model's ``state_dict``, optimizer's ``state_dict``, and trial's
   hyperparameters respectively.

Determined will automatically create checkpoints for all the trials in an
experiment. Checkpoints are created in three situations:

1. When Determined suspends training of a trial at one agent, before later
   resuming training that trial at a different agent.
2. If ``min_checkpoint_period`` is set in the experiment configuration,
   each trial will be checkpointed whenever the specified number of
   training steps are completed since the last checkpoint.
3. When a trial has been trained to completion (according to the
   configuration of the experiment's trial search method).

The Determined CLI can be used to view all the checkpoints associated with an
experiment:

.. code:: bash

   $ det experiment list-checkpoints <experiment-id>

Checkpoints are saved to external storage, as specified in the
experiment configuration; see the discussion of ``checkpoint_storage``
above. Each checkpoint has a UUID, which is used as the name of the
checkpoint directory on the external storage system. For example, if the
experiment is configured to save checkpoints to a shared file system:

.. code:: yaml

   checkpoint_storage:
     type: shared_fs
     host_path: /mnt/nfs-volume-1

A checkpoint with UUID ``b3ed462c-a6c9-41e9-9202-5cb8ff00e109`` can be
found in the directory
``/mnt/nfs-volume-1/b3ed462c-a6c9-41e9-9202-5cb8ff00e109``.

The Determined CLI can be used to download a checkpoint saved on S3 or GCS:

.. code:: bash

   $ det checkpoint download <trial-id> <step-id>

.. _checkpoint-garbage-collection:

Checkpoint Garbage Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically only some checkpoints are appropriate for deployment. Once an
experiment has finished, Determined can optionally garbage collect some or all
of the checkpoints taken when the experiment was running. The following
parameters in the ``checkpoint_storage`` section of the experiment
configuration specify which checkpoints to save:

-  ``save_experiment_best``: The number of the best checkpoints with
   validations over all trials to save (where best is measured by the
   validation metric specified in the searcher configuration).
-  ``save_trial_best``: The number of the best checkpoints with
   validations of each trial to save.
-  ``save_trial_latest``: The number of the latest checkpoints of each
   trial to save.

If multiple ``save_*`` parameters are specified, the union of the
specified checkpoints are saved.

Default GC Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any GC policy parameter that isn't specified will default to the
following respective value:

.. code:: yaml

    save_experiment_best: 0
    save_trial_best: 1
    save_trial_latest: 1

This policy will save the most recent *and* the best checkpoint per
trial. In other words, if the most recent checkpoint is also the *best*
checkpoint for a given trial, only one checkpoint will be saved for that
trial. Otherwise, two checkpoints will be saved for that trial.

Example
^^^^^^^

Suppose an experiment has the following trials, checkpoints and
validation metrics (where ``smaller_is_better`` is true):

======== ============= =================
Trial ID Checkpoint ID Validation Metric
======== ============= =================
1        1             null
1        2             null
1        3             0.6
1        4             0.5
1        5             0.4
2        6             null
2        7             0.2
2        8             0.3
2        9             null
2        10            null
======== ============= =================

The effect of various policies is enumerated in the following table:

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| ``save_exp     | ``sav          | ``save_        | Saved          |

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

If aggressive reclamation is desired, set ``save_experiment_best`` to a
1 or 2 and leave the other parameters zero. For more conservative
reclamation, set ``save_trial_best`` to 1 or 2; optionally set
``save_trial_latest`` as well.

Checkpoints of an existing experiment can be garbage collected by
changing the GC policy using the ``det experiment set gc-policy``
subcommand of the Determined CLI.

.. _checkpoint-storage-configuration:

Checkpoint Storage Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A default checkpoint storage will be used when each experiment is created. It
is recommended to create a default checkpoint configuration that will be used
by all pertinent tasks started by the cluster. To configure this value, edit
the ``checkpoint_storage`` configuration in cluster configuration with the
desired type and location of checkpoint storage. See
:ref:`cluster-configuration` for details. However, every experiment can still
be configured with a specific checkpoint storage. See
:ref:`experiment-configuration` for details.
