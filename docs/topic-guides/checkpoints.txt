.. _exporting-checkpoints:

Exporting Models and Checkpoints
----------------------------------------

After training a model that achieves satisfactory performance, it is
often important to export the model for use outside Determined (e.g.,
to deploy the model as part of a web service or on an embedded device).
In the current version of Determined, exporting models is supported by copying
the **checkpoints** that are automatically created during the training
process.

A checkpoint includes the model definition (Python source code), experiment
configuration file, network architecture, and the values of the model's
parameters (i.e., weights) and hyperparameters. When using a stateful optimizer
during training, checkpoints will also include the state of the optimizer (i.e.,
learning rate). Users can also embed arbitrary metadata in checkpoints via a
:ref:`Python API <store-checkpoint-metadata>`.

The exact checkpoint format depends on the application framework being used:

TensorFlow Estimator
  Trials are checkpointed using the
  `SavedModel <https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/saved_model#structure_of_a_savedmodel_directory>`__
  format. Please consult the TensorFlow documentation to restore models
  from the SavedModel format.

TensorFlow Keras
  Trials are checkpointed to a file named ``determined-keras-model.h5`` using
  ``tf.keras.models.save_model``. You can learn more from the `TF Keras docs
  <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/keras/models/save_model>`__.

PyTorch
  Trials are checkpointed as a ``state-dict.pth`` file. This file is created in
  a similar manner to the procedure described in the `PyTorch documentation
  <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#saving-loading-a-general-checkpoint-for-inference-and-or-resuming-training>`__. Instead
  of the fields in the documentation linked above, the dictionary will have four
  keys: ``models_state_dict``, ``optimizers_state_dict``,
  ``lr_schedulers_state_dict``, and ``callbacks``, which are the ``state_dict`` of
  the models, optimizers, LR schedulers, and callbacks respectively.

Determined will automatically create checkpoints for each trial in an
experiment. Checkpoints are created in three situations:

1. When Determined suspends training of a trial at one agent, before later
   resuming training that trial at a different agent.
2. If :ref:`min_checkpoint_period <experiment-config-min-checkpoint-period>` is
   set in the experiment configuration, each trial will be checkpointed whenever
   the specified number of training steps are completed since the last
   checkpoint.
3. When a trial has been trained to completion (according to the
   configuration of the experiment's trial search method).

The Determined CLI can be used to view all the checkpoints associated with an
experiment:

.. code:: bash

   $ det experiment list-checkpoints <experiment-id>

Checkpoints are saved to external storage, according to the
:ref:`checkpoint_storage <checkpoint-storage>` section in either the experiment
configuration or the master configuration. Each checkpoint has a UUID, which is
used as the name of the checkpoint directory on the external storage system. For
example, if the experiment is configured to save checkpoints to a shared file
system:

.. code:: yaml

   checkpoint_storage:
     type: shared_fs
     host_path: /mnt/nfs-volume-1

A checkpoint with UUID ``b3ed462c-a6c9-41e9-9202-5cb8ff00e109`` can be
found in the directory
``/mnt/nfs-volume-1/b3ed462c-a6c9-41e9-9202-5cb8ff00e109``.

The Determined CLI can be used to download a checkpoint saved on a shared file system, S3 or GCS:

.. code:: bash

   $ det checkpoint download <trial-id> <step-id>

.. warning::

    When downloading checkpoints in a shared file system, we assume the same
    shared file system is mounted locally.

.. _checkpoint-garbage-collection:

Checkpoint Garbage Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically only some checkpoints need to be retained for future use. Once an
experiment has finished, Determined can optionally garbage collect some or all
of the checkpoints taken when the experiment was running. The following
parameters in the ``checkpoint_storage`` section of the experiment
configuration specify which checkpoints to save:

-  ``save_experiment_best``: The number of the best checkpoints with
   validations over all trials to save (where best is measured by the
   validation metric specified in the searcher configuration).
-  ``save_trial_best``: The number of the best checkpoints with
   validations of each trial to save.
-  ``save_trial_latest``: The number of the latest checkpoints of each
   trial to save.

If multiple ``save_*`` parameters are specified, the union of the
specified checkpoints are saved.

Default GC Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any GC policy parameter that isn't specified will default to the
following respective value:

.. code:: yaml

    save_experiment_best: 0
    save_trial_best: 1
    save_trial_latest: 1

This policy will save the most recent *and* the best checkpoint per
trial. In other words, if the most recent checkpoint is also the *best*
checkpoint for a given trial, only one checkpoint will be saved for that
trial. Otherwise, two checkpoints will be saved.

Example
^^^^^^^

Suppose an experiment has the following trials, checkpoints and
validation metrics (where ``smaller_is_better`` is true):

======== ============= =================
Trial ID Checkpoint ID Validation Metric
======== ============= =================
1        1             null
1        2             null
1        3             0.6
1        4             0.5
1        5             0.4
2        6             null
2        7             0.2
2        8             0.3
2        9             null
2        10            null
======== ============= =================

The effect of various policies is enumerated in the following table:

+--------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+----------------------+

If aggressive reclamation is desired, set ``save_experiment_best`` to a
1 or 2 and leave the other parameters zero. For more conservative
reclamation, set ``save_trial_best`` to 1 or 2; optionally set
``save_trial_latest`` as well.

Checkpoints of an existing experiment can be garbage collected by
changing the GC policy using the ``det experiment set gc-policy``
subcommand of the Determined CLI.

.. _checkpoint-storage-configuration:

Checkpoint Storage Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A default checkpoint storage will be used when each experiment is created. It is
recommended to create a default checkpoint configuration that will be used by
all pertinent tasks started by the cluster. To configure this value, edit the
``checkpoint_storage`` section in the :ref:`master configuration
<master-configuration>` with the desired type and location of checkpoint
storage. Individual experiments can override this value to specify a custom
checkpoint storage location via the experiment configuration file.
