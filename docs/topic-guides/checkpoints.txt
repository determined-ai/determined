 Exporting Models and Checkpoints
##################################

After training a model that achieves satisfactory performance, it is
often important to export the model for use outside Determined (e.g., to
deploy the model as part of a web service or on an embedded device). In
the current version of Determined, exporting models is supported by
copying the **checkpoints** that are automatically created during the
training process.

A checkpoint includes the model definition (Python source code),
experiment configuration file, network architecture, and the values of
the model's parameters (i.e., weights) and hyperparameters. When using a
stateful optimizer during training, checkpoints will also include the
state of the optimizer (i.e., learning rate). Users can also embed
arbitrary metadata in checkpoints via a :ref:`Python API
<store-checkpoint-metadata>`.

The exact checkpoint format depends on the application framework being
used:

TensorFlow Estimator
   Trials are checkpointed using the `SavedModel
   <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model>`__ format. Please
   consult the TensorFlow documentation for details on how to restore
   models from the SavedModel format.

TensorFlow Keras
   Trials are checkpointed to a file named ``determined-keras-model.h5``
   using ``tf.keras.models.save_model``. You can learn more from the `TF
   Keras docs
   <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/keras/models/save_model>`__.

PyTorch
   Trials are checkpointed as a ``state-dict.pth`` file. This file is
   created in a similar manner to the procedure described in the
   `PyTorch documentation
   <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#saving-loading-a-general-checkpoint-for-inference-and-or-resuming-training>`__.
   Instead of the fields in the documentation linked above, the
   dictionary will have four keys: ``models_state_dict``,
   ``optimizers_state_dict``, ``lr_schedulers_state_dict``, and
   ``callbacks``, which are the ``state_dict`` of the models,
   optimizers, LR schedulers, and callbacks respectively.

Determined will automatically create checkpoints for each trial in an
experiment. Checkpoints are created in four situations:

#. When Determined suspends training of a trial at one agent, before
   later resuming training that trial at a different agent.

#. If :ref:`min_checkpoint_period
   <experiment-config-min-checkpoint-period>` is set in the experiment
   configuration, each trial will be checkpointed whenever the specified
   training length is completed since the last checkpoint.

#. When a trial has been trained to completion (according to the
   configuration of the experiment's trial search method).

#. Before the search method makes a decision based on a validation of a
   trial, Determined will checkpoint that trial to guarantee consistency
   in the event of a failure.

The Determined CLI can be used to view all the checkpoints associated
with an experiment:

.. code:: bash

   $ det experiment list-checkpoints <experiment-id>

Checkpoints are saved to external storage, according to the
:ref:`checkpoint_storage <checkpoint-storage>` section in either the
experiment configuration or the master configuration. Each checkpoint
has a UUID, which is used as the name of the checkpoint directory on the
external storage system. For example, if the experiment is configured to
save checkpoints to a shared file system:

.. code:: yaml

   checkpoint_storage:
     type: shared_fs
     host_path: /mnt/nfs-volume-1

A checkpoint with UUID ``b3ed462c-a6c9-41e9-9202-5cb8ff00e109`` can be
found in the directory
``/mnt/nfs-volume-1/b3ed462c-a6c9-41e9-9202-5cb8ff00e109``.

The Determined CLI can be used to download a checkpoint saved on a
shared file system, S3 or GCS:

.. code:: bash

   $ det checkpoint download <trial-id> <step-id>

.. warning::

   When downloading checkpoints in a shared file system, we assume the
   same shared file system is mounted locally.

.. _checkpoint-garbage-collection:

*******************************
 Checkpoint Garbage Collection
*******************************

Typically only some checkpoints need to be retained for future use. Once
an experiment has finished, Determined can optionally garbage collect
some or all of the checkpoints taken when the experiment was running.
The following parameters in the ``checkpoint_storage`` section of the
experiment configuration specify which checkpoints to save:

-  ``save_experiment_best``: The number of the best checkpoints with
   validations over all trials to save (where best is measured by the
   validation metric specified in the searcher configuration).

-  ``save_trial_best``: The number of the best checkpoints with
   validations of each trial to save.

-  ``save_trial_latest``: The number of the latest checkpoints of each
   trial to save.

If multiple ``save_*`` parameters are specified, the union of the
specified checkpoints are saved.

Default GC Policy
=================

Any GC policy parameter that isn't specified will default to the
following respective value:

.. code:: yaml

   save_experiment_best: 0
   save_trial_best: 1
   save_trial_latest: 1

This policy will save the most recent *and* the best checkpoint per
trial. In other words, if the most recent checkpoint is also the *best*
checkpoint for a given trial, only one checkpoint will be saved for that
trial. Otherwise, two checkpoints will be saved.

Example
=======

Suppose an experiment has the following trials, checkpoints and
validation metrics (where ``smaller_is_better`` is true):

+--------+-------------+-----------------+
| Trial  | Checkpoint  | Validation      |
| ID     | ID          | Metric          |
+========+=============+=================+
| 1      | 1           | null            |
+--------+-------------+-----------------+
| 1      | 2           | null            |
+--------+-------------+-----------------+
| 1      | 3           | 0.6             |
+--------+-------------+-----------------+
| 1      | 4           | 0.5             |
+--------+-------------+-----------------+
| 1      | 5           | 0.4             |
+--------+-------------+-----------------+
| 2      | 6           | null            |
+--------+-------------+-----------------+
| 2      | 7           | 0.2             |
+--------+-------------+-----------------+
| 2      | 8           | 0.3             |
+--------+-------------+-----------------+
| 2      | 9           | null            |
+--------+-------------+-----------------+
| 2      | 10          | null            |
+--------+-------------+-----------------+

The effect of various policies is enumerated in the following table:

+--------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+----------------------+
| ``save_experiment_best`` | ``save_trial_best`` | ``save_trial_latest`` | Saved Checkpoint IDs |

If aggressive reclamation is desired, set ``save_experiment_best`` to a
1 or 2 and leave the other parameters zero. For more conservative
reclamation, set ``save_trial_best`` to 1 or 2; optionally set
``save_trial_latest`` as well.

Checkpoints of an existing experiment can be garbage collected by
changing the GC policy using the ``det experiment set gc-policy``
subcommand of the Determined CLI.

.. _checkpoint-storage-configuration:

**********************************
 Checkpoint Storage Configuration
**********************************

A default checkpoint storage will be used when each experiment is
created. It is recommended to create a default checkpoint configuration
that will be used by all pertinent tasks started by the cluster. To
configure this value, edit the ``checkpoint_storage`` section in the
:ref:`master configuration <master-configuration>` with the desired type
and location of checkpoint storage. Individual experiments can override
this value to specify a custom checkpoint storage location via the
experiment configuration file.
