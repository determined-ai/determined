Elastic Infrastructure
=============================

This document describes how Determined automatically scales its cluster to
provide adequate computation resources for workloads as well as leverage
computational resources. It assumes some familiarity with the terms make
in :ref:`det-system-architecture`: **master**, **agent**, **slot**, and
**workload**.

Architecture Diagram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The diagram below outlines the high level architecture of the elastic
infrastructure.

Following the diagram, the execution would be:

#. The master collects the information on the agents and the workloads.
#. The master calculates out the ideal size of the cluster and decide how many
   agents to launch and which agents to terminate.
#. The master makes API calls to agent providers, such as AWS and GCP, to scale
   up/down the cluster.

Architecture Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The master collects information on idle agents that have no running workloads
and on pending workloads waiting to be scheduled and uses this information
to scale the cluster automatically.

-  When workloads are pending and cannot be scheduled due to lack of
   available agents, the master calculates the number of agents that are
   needed to take on these pending workloads. The calculation is done
   based on the configuration of scaling behavior and agent type.
   Then it makes API calls to ask agent providers for more agents within
   a few seconds of new workloads arriving. Agents will
   spin up automatically and once these agents are able to be discovered
   by the master, the free slots on these agents will be scheduled with
   pending workloads. The time for the agents to be discovered varies
   on different agent providers.
-  When there are no workloads running on agents, these agents are marked as idle
   agents. We give them a grace period before making API calls to terminate them.
   This grace period gives some time to these agents to be scheduled with
   new workloads.
