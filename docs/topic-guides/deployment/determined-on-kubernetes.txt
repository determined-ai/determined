This guide describes how the Determined deep learning platform works on
`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__. For instructions on installing
Determined on Kubernetes, please see the :ref:`installation guide
<install-on-kubernetes>`.

In this topic guide, we will cover:

#. How Determined works on Kubernetes.
#. Limitations of Determined on Kubernetes.
#. Useful Helm and Kubectl commands.

************************************
 How Determined Works on Kubernetes
************************************

:ref:`Installing Determined on Kubernetes <install-on-kubernetes>`
deploys an instance of the Determined master and a Postgres database in
the Kubernetes cluster. Once the master is up and running, users can
submit :ref:`experiments <quick-start-first-job>` and launch
:ref:`notebooks <how-to-notebooks>`, :ref:`tensorboards
<how-to-tensorboard>`, commands, and shells. When new workloads are
submitted to the Determined master, the master launches pods and
configMaps on the Kubernetes cluster to execute those workloads. Users
of Determined shouldn't need to interact with Kubernetes directly after
installation, as Determined handles all the necessary interaction with
the Kubernetes cluster.

.. _limitations-on-kubernetes:

*****************************************
 Limitations of Determined on Kubernetes
*****************************************

This section outlines the current limitations of Determined on
Kubernetes.

Scheduling
==========

By default, the Kubernetes scheduler does not support gang scheduling or
preemption. This can be problematic for distributed deep learning
workloads that require multiple pods to be scheduled before execution
starts. Determined includes built-in support for the `lightweight
coscheduling plugin
<https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/tree/release-1.18/pkg/coscheduling>`__,
which extends the default Kubernetes scheduler to support gang
scheduling. The coscheduling plugin is not enabled by default. For more
details and instructions on how to enable the coscheduling plugin, refer
to :ref:`scheduling-on-kubernetes`.

Dynamic Agents
==============

Determined is not able to autoscale your cluster, but equivalent
functionality is available by using the `Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler
<https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler>`_,
which is supported on `GKE
<https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-autoscaler>`_
and `EKS
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-autoscaler.html>`_.

.. _useful-kubectl-commands:

**********************************
 Useful Helm and Kubectl Commands
**********************************

`kubectl <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/>`_ is
a command-line tool for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster. `Helm
<https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/>`_ is used to install and
upgrade Determined on Kubernetes. This section covers some of the useful
kubectl and helm commands when :ref:`running Determined on Kubernetes
<install-on-kubernetes>`.

For all the commands listed below, include ``-n <kubernetes namespace
name>`` if running Determined in a non-default `namespace
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/>`_.

List Installations of Determined
================================

To list the current installation of Determined on the Kubernetes
cluster:

.. code:: bash

   # To list in the current namespace.
   helm list

   # To list in all namespaces.
   helm list -A

It is recommended to have just one instance of Determined per Kubernetes
cluster.

Get the IP Address of the Determined Master
===========================================

To get the IP and port address of the Determined master:

.. code:: bash

   # Get all services.
   kubectl get services

   # Get the master service. The exact name of the master service depends on
   # the name given to your helm deployment, which can be looked up by running
   # ``helm list``.
   kubectl get service determined-master-service-<helm deployment name>

Check the Status of the Determined Master
=========================================

Logs for the Determined master are available via the CLI and WebUI.
``Kubectl`` commands are useful for diagnosing any issues that arise
during installation.

.. code:: bash

   # Get all deployments.
   kubectl get deployments

   # Describe the current state of Determined master deployment. The exact name
   # of the master deployment depends on the name given to your helm deploy
   # which can be looked up by running `helm list`.
   kubectl describe deployment determined-master-deployment-<helm deployment name>

   # Get all pods associated with the Determined master deployment. Note this
   # will only include pods that are running the Determined master, not pods
   # that are running tasks associated with Determined workloads.
   kubectl get pods -l=app=determined-master-<helm deployment name>

   # Get logs for the pod running the Determined master.
   kubectl logs <determined-master-pod-name>

Get All the Running Task Pods
=============================

These ``kubectl`` commands list and delete pods which are running
Determined tasks:

.. code:: bash

   # Get all pods that are running Determined tasks.
   kubectl get pods -l=determined

   # Delete all Determined task pods. Users should never have to run this,
   # unless they are removing a deployment of Determined.
   kubectl get pods --no-headers=true -l=determined | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete pod
