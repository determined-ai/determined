 Determined on AWS
###################

This document describes the resources needed to run a Determined cluster
on AWS.

**********
 Overview
**********

A master node (a single, non-GPU instance) manages the cluster,
provisioning and terminating agent nodes dynamically as new workloads
are started by users. The master stores metadata in an external
database; using AWS Aurora or RDS is recommended. Users interact with
the cluster by using a CLI or a visiting the WebUI hosted on the master.
Nodes in the cluster communicate with one another over a Virtual Private
Cloud (VPC); users interact with the master via a designated external
port configured during installation.

Following the diagram, a standard execution would be:

#. User submits experiment to master
#. Master creates one or more agents (depending on experiment) if they
   don't exist
#. Agent accesses required data, images, etc.
#. Agent completes experiment and communicates completion to master
#. Master shuts down agents that are no longer needed

**********************
 Architecture Details
**********************

This section provides details on the core resources, which are required
to run Determined, and peripheral resources, which are optionally
configurable based on user requirements.

Core Resources
==============

-  **Master Node**: A single EC2 instance that:

   -  hosts the Determined WebUI where users monitor their experiments
   -  responds to commands from the Determined CLI
   -  schedules workloads
   -  manages other EC2 instances (agents) that run experiments

-  **Agent Node(s)**: For most Determined clusters in AWS, the number of
   agents varies with the volume and type of workloads currently
   running. All agents are managed by the master and users do not have
   to interact with them directly. For more information on scaling
   clusters, or dynamic agents, see :ref:`elastic-infrastructure`.

-  **Database**: Determined uses an Amazon Relational Database Service
   (Postgres) database to store metadata.

-  **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: IAM roles are attached
   to the instances to manage the creation of compute (EC2) resources
   and access to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets for
   checkpoints, TensorBoards, and other data storage as needed.

-  **Security Groups**: VPC Security Groups ensure that each node in the
   cluster can communicate with each other.

Periphery Resources
===================

-  **Network/Subnetwork**: The Determined cluster runs in an existing or
   newly created VPC.

-  **Elastic IP**: For production clusters, the master should have an
   associated elastic IP; otherwise, AWS automatically assigns an
   ephemeral IP.

-  **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Bucket**: The Determined cluster
   can leverage an existing S3 bucket (assuming it has the correct
   associated permissions), or the CloudFormation script can create a
   bucket with the cluster.
