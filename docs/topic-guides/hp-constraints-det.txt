 Hyperparameter Search Constraints
###################################

Determined's Hyperparameter Search Constraints API enables finer-grained
control over the hyperparameter search space through the specification
of additional constraints. Among other things, this functionality is
particularly useful for incorporating prior knowledge/domain expertise
into a hyperparameter search and constraining the search to models that
fit a particular deployment environment.

Using Determined's HP Search Constraints requires no changes to the
configuration files. Rather, users can simply raise a
`determined.InvalidHP` exception in their model code when the trial is
first created in the `__init__` or at any subsequent point during
training. This user-raised exception is then handled by Determined's
system internally – resulting in the graceful stop of the current trial
being trained, logging the InvalidHP in the trial logs, and propagating
that information to the search method.

.. warning::

   It is important to note that each search method has different
   behavior when a `determined.InvalidHP` is raised by the user in
   accordance with the internal dynamics of each searcher, as detailed
   below.

***************************************************************
 HP Search Constraints usage in PyTorch vs. TF Keras/Estimator
***************************************************************

Since the PyTorch and TF Keras/Estimator APIs have different behavior,
it follows that the timing/placement of user-raised InvalidHP exceptions
would be different.

In the case of PyTorch, this exception can be raised in either the trial
`__init__`, `train_batch`, or `evaluate_batch`. In the case of either TF
Keras and TF Estimator, it is valid for the user to raise this exception
in either the `__init__` or in an `on_checkpoint_end` callback.

See this

for an example on HP Search Constraints usage.

.. list-table::

   -  -  Search Algorithm
      -  HP Search Constraints Behavior

   -  -  Single
      -  Not applicable to HP Search Constraints as only a single
         hyperparameter configuration will be trained.

   -  -  Grid
      -  Does nothing since grid does not take actions based on search
         status or progress.

   -  -  Random

      -  Gracefully terminates current trial, creates a new trial with a
         randomly sampled set of hyperparameters and adds it to the
         trial queue.

   -  -  PBT

      -  Does not have specific InvalidHP handling and will treat as a
         poor performing trial that will be replaced with either a new
         hyperparameter setting or a perturbation of a high performing
         hyperparameter setting.

   -  -  Adaptive (ASHA)

      -  Gracefully terminates and removes associated metrics with the
         current trial and creates a new trial with a randomly sampled
         set of hyperparameters.
