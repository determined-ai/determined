 Hyperparameter Search Constraints
###################################

Determined's Hyperparameter Search Constraints API enables finer-grained control over the
hyperparameter search space through the specification of additional constraints. Among other things,
this functionality is particularly useful for incorporating prior knowledge/domain expertise into a
hyperparameter search and constraining the search to models that fit a particular deployment
environment.

Using Determined's HP Search Constraints requires no changes to the configuration files. Rather,
users can simply raise a ``determined.InvalidHP`` exception in their model code when the trial is
first created in the ``__init__`` or at any subsequent point during training. This user-raised
exception is then handled by Determined's system internally â€“ resulting in the graceful stop of the
current trial being trained, logging the InvalidHP in the trial logs, and propagating that
information to the search method.

.. warning::

   It is important to note that each search method has different behavior when a
   ``determined.InvalidHP`` is raised by the user in accordance with the internal dynamics of each
   searcher, as detailed below.

***************************************************************
 HP Search Constraints usage in PyTorch vs. TF Keras/Estimator
***************************************************************

Since the PyTorch and TF Keras/Estimator APIs have different behavior, it follows that the
timing/placement of user-raised InvalidHP exceptions would be different.

In the case of PyTorch, this exception can be raised in either the trial ``__init__``,
``train_batch``, or ``evaluate_batch``. In the case of either TF Keras and TF Estimator, it is valid
for the user to raise this exception in either the ``__init__`` or in an ``on_checkpoint_end``
callback.

See this

for an example on HP Search Constraints usage.

   -  -  Search Algorithm
      -  HP Search Constraints Behavior

   -  -  Single
      -  Not applicable to HP Search Constraints as only a single hyperparameter configuration will
         be trained.

   -  -  Grid
      -  Does nothing since grid does not take actions based on search status or progress.

   -  -  Random
      -  Gracefully terminates current trial, creates a new trial with a randomly sampled set of
         hyperparameters and adds it to the trial queue.

   -  -  PBT

      -  Does not have specific InvalidHP handling and will treat as a poor performing trial that
         will be replaced with either a new hyperparameter setting or a perturbation of a high
         performing hyperparameter setting.

   -  -  Adaptive (ASHA)
      -  Gracefully terminates and removes associated metrics with the current trial and creates a
         new trial with a randomly sampled set of hyperparameters.
