 Terminology and Concepts
##########################

agent
   A machine, typically with GPUs, that is used for training models and
   running other tasks, such as notebooks and TensorBoards. The master
   handles provisioning and deprovisioning agent instances in cloud
   settings. More information can be found at
   :ref:`det-system-architecture`.

command-line interface (CLI)
   A tool for interacting with Determined from a command line. The CLI
   is installed with the command name ``det``. More information can be
   found at :ref:`cli`.

configuration file
   A :ref:`YAML <topic-guides_yaml>` file that contains options to pass
   to Determined. For example, an experiment configuration file contains
   information on the training length, data location, hyperparameters,
   and other options for an experiment. More information can be found at
   :ref:`experiment-configuration`, :ref:`cluster-configuration`, and
   :ref:`command-notebook-configuration`.

context directory
   The directory that is uploaded to the master when an experiment is
   created. It must contain all code that is part of the model
   definition.

distributed training
   Using multiple GPUs to speed up the training of a single trial. In
   Determined, these GPUs might all be on the same machine, or might be
   spread across multiple machines --- note that we call both scenarios
   "distributed training", which might differ from the terminology used
   in other systems.

.. _concept-experiment:

experiment
   A collection of one or more trials that are exploring a user-defined
   hyperparameter space. For example, during a learning rate
   hyperparameter search, an experiment can consist of three trials with
   learning rates of .001, .01, and .1. In Determined, experiments are
   the main grouping mechanism for training tasks.

master
   The central component of the Determined system. The master schedules
   workloads onto agents, manages the provisioning and deprovisioning of
   agents in cloud settings, and serves the frontend. More information
   can be found at :ref:`det-system-architecture`.

model definition
   A specification of a deep learning model written in a supported deep
   learning framework. The model definition contains training code that
   inherits from a Python class provided by Determined
   (:class:`~determined.keras.TFKerasTrial`,
   :class:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial`, or
   :class:`~determined.estimator.EstimatorTrial`). More information can
   be found at :ref:`model-definitions`.

searcher, search algorithm
   A type of hyperparameter search to use. The search algorithm
   determines how many trials will be run for a particular experiment
   and how the hyperparameters will be set. More information can be
   found at :ref:`topic-guides_hp-tuning-det`.

slot
   A resource (GPU or CPU) that can be used for training. The maximum
   number of slots that an experiment can use can be set in the
   experiment configuration file or using the Determined CLI.

.. _concept-trial:

trial
   A training task with a dataset, a deep learning model, and a defined
   set of hyperparameters.

workload
   A discrete unit of work with one purpose related to training a model.
   A workload will either train the model on a certain amount of data,
   checkpoint the state, or validate the model's performance.
