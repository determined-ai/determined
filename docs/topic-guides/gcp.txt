 Determined on GCP
###################

This document describes how Determined runs on Google Cloud Platform
(GCP).

**********
 Overview
**********

At a high level, Determined uses Google Compute Engine (GCE) instances
as the base unit. The cluster is managed by a `master` node (a single,
non-GPU instance), which in turn provisions and deprovisions other
`agent` nodes (GPU instances) depending on the current volume of
experiments being run on the cluster. As an example, if only a `master`
node is running, then you are only being charged for the master. When an
experiment is started, the master creates GPU instances as `agents`, and
when the experiment is done the master will turn off the `agents` so you
are not charged for them when no experiments are using them. The master
also keeps all experiment metadata in a separate database, which can be
queried by the user via the Determined WebUI or CLI. All nodes in the
cluster communicate with each other internally within the Virtual
Private Cloud (VPC) and the user interacts with the master via a
designated port configured during installation.

The diagram below outlines the high level architecture of a Determined
cluster in GCP.

Following the diagram, a standard execution would be:

#. User submits experiment to master
#. Master creates one or more agents (depending on experiment) if they
   don't exist
#. Agent accesses required data, images, etc.
#. Agent completes experiment and communicates completion to master
#. Master shuts down agents that are no longer needed

 Architecture Details

There are two types of resources used to run Determined: core resources
that enable the Determined platform, and periphery resources that add
optional functionality. The section below provides additional detail on
these resources, and users can deploy these resources in GCP following
the :ref:`install-gcp` How-To guide..

Core Resources
==============

-  **Master Node**: A single Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance is
   designated as the `master`. The master's primary function is to:

   -  host the cluster's WebUI (browser) where users will monitor their
      experiments
   -  respond to commands from the Determined CLI installed by users
      locally
   -  schedule experiments
   -  manage other GCE instances (`agents`) which run experiments

-  **Agent Node(s)**: For most Determined clusters in GCP, the volume of
   active experiments dictate the number of `agents`. All `agents` are
   managed by the `master` and users need not interact with the `agents`
   directly.

-  **Database**: Determined uses a CloudSQL (Postgres) database for
   storing all experiment metadata.

-  **Service Account**: A service account is used to manage the creation
   of compute (GCE) resources and access to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
   buckets for checkpoints, TensorBoards, and other data storage as
   needed.

-  **Firewall Rules**: Firewall rules are set to ensure each node in the
   cluster can communicate with each other.

Periphery Resources
===================

-  **Network/Subnetwork**: The Determined cluster can be configured
   inside an existing VPC or be set to create a new VPC.

-  **Static IP**: For production clusters, a static IP is recommended
   for the master; otherwise an ephemeral IP is automatically generated
   by GCP.

-  **Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket**: The Determined cluster can
   leverage an existing GCS bucket (assuming it has the correct
   associated permissions), or the Terraform script can create a bucket
   with the cluster.
