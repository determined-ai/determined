Hyperparameter Search: Single
=============================

The ``single`` search method does a very minimal "search": it trains a
single hyperparameter configuration for the number of units specified by ``max_length``
(see :ref:`Training Units<experiment-configuration_training_units>`) and then
performs validation. This method is useful for testing or for training a
single model configuration until convergence.
