Hyperparameter Search: Adaptive (Advanced)
==========================================

The ``adaptive`` search method employs the same underlying algorithm as the
:ref:`Adaptive (Simple) <topic-guides_hp-tuning-det_adaptive-simple>` method,
but it allows users to control the behavior of the search in a more fine-grained
way at the cost of being more difficult to configure. This section explains the
configuration settings that influence the behavior of the ``adaptive`` searcher
and gives recommendations for how to configure those settings.

Quick start
-----------

Here are some suggested initial settings for ``adaptive`` that typically
work well.

Search mode:

-  ``mode``: Set to ``standard``.

Resource budget:

-  ``target_trial_steps``: The maximum number of steps that any trial
   that survives to the end of the experiment will be trained for (a
   *step* is a `fixed number <batches-per-step>`__ of batches). This quantity
   is domain-specific and should roughly reflect the number of training steps
   needed for the model to converge on the data set. For users who would like
   to determine this number experimentally, train a model with reasonable
   hyperparameters using the ``single`` search method.
-  ``step_budget``: Set ``step_budget`` to roughly 10 times
   ``target_trial_steps``. A higher ``step_budget`` will result in
   hyperparameter search that consumes more resources and takes longer
   to complete, but may produce better-performing models.

Details
-------

Conceptually, the ``adaptive`` searcher is a carefully tuned strategy
for spawning multiple *ASHA* (asynchronous successive halving algorithm)
searchers, themselves hyperparameter search algorithms. ASHA can be
configured to make different tradeoffs between exploration and
exploitation, i.e., how many trials are explored versus how long a
single trial is trained for. Because the right tradeoff between
exploration and exploitation is hard to know in advance, the
``adaptive`` algorithm tries several ASHA searches with different
tradeoffs.

The configuration settings available to Determined experiments running
in ``adaptive`` mode mostly affect the ASHA subroutines directly. The
``mode`` configuration is the only one affecting the decisions of the
``adaptive`` searcher, by changing the number and types of ASHA
subroutines spawned.

The first section here gives a description of ASHA. The second section
describes the configuration parameters that influence how this search
method behaves. The third section gives a summary of the ``adaptive``
configuration settings.

ASHA
~~~~

At a high level, ASHA prunes ("halves") a set of trials in successive rounds we
call *rungs*. ASHA starts with an initial set of trials. (A trial means a single
model with a fixed set of hyperparameter values.) ASHA trains all the trials for
some number of steps and the trials with the worst validation performance are
discarded. In the next rung, the remaining trials are trained for a longer
period of time, and then trials with the worst validation performance are pruned
once again.  This is repeated until the maximum number of training steps is
reached.

First, an example of ASHA.

-  Rung 1: ASHA creates N initial trials; the hyperparameter values for
   each trial are randomly sampled from the hyperparameters defined in
   the experiment configuration file. Each trial is trained for 3 steps,
   and then validation metrics are computed.
-  Rung 2: ASHA picks the N/4 top-performing trials according to
   validation metrics. These are trained for 12 steps.
-  Rung 3: ASHA picks the N/16 top-performing trials according to
   validation metrics. These are trained for 48 steps.

At the end, the trial with best performance has the hyperparameter
setting the ASHA searcher returns.

In the example above, ``divisor`` is 4, which controls the fraction
of trials that are kept in successive rungs, as well as the number of steps
in successive rungs. ``target_trial_steps`` is 48, which is the maximum
number of steps a trial is trained for.

The remaining degree of freedom in this ASHA example is the number N of
initial trials. This is determined by the top-level adaptive algorithm,
through ``step_budget`` and the number/types of ASHA subroutines called.

In general, ASHA has a fixed ``divisor`` d. In the first rung, it
generates an initial set of randomly chosen trials and runs until each
trial has completed the same number of steps. In the next rung, it keeps
1/d of those trials and closes the rest. Then it runs each remaining
trial until it has completed d times as many steps as after the previous
rung. ASHA iterates this process until some stopping criterion is
reached, such as completing a specified number of rungs or having only
one trial remaining. The number of steps, rungs, and trials within rungs
are fixed within each ASHA searcher, but vary across different calls to
ASHA by the adaptive algorithm. Note that although the name "ASHA"
includes the phrase "halving", the fraction of trials pruned after every
rung is controlled by ``divisor``.

Adaptive over ASHA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The adaptive algorithm calls ASHA subroutines with varying parameters.
The exact calls are configured through the choice of ``mode``, which
specifies how aggressively to perform early stopping. One way to think
about this behavior is as a spectrum that ranges from "one ASHA run"
(aggressive early stopping; eliminate most trials every rung) to
"``searcher: random``" (no early stopping; all initialized trials are
allowed to run to completion).

On one end, ``aggressive`` applies early stopping in a very eager
manner; this mode essentially corresponds to only making a single call
to ASHA. With the default ``divisor`` of 4, 75% of the remaining trials
will be eliminated in each rung after only being trained for 25% as many
training steps as will be performed in the next rung. This implies that
relatively few of the trials will be allowed to finish even a small
fraction of the training steps needed for a full training run
(``target_trial_steps``). This aggressive early stopping behavior allows
the searcher to start more trials for a wider exploration of
hyperparameter configurations, at the risk of discarding a configuration
too soon.

On the other end, ``conservative`` mode is more similar to a ``random``
search, in that it performs significantly less pruning. Extra ASHA
subroutines are spawned with fewer rungs and larger training steps to
account for the high percentage of trials eliminated after only a few
steps. However, a ``conservative`` adaptive search will only explore a
small fraction of the configurations explored by an ``aggressive``
search, given the same step budget.

Once the number and types of calls to ASHA are determined (via
``mode``), the adaptive algorithm will allocate budgets of steps to the
ASHA subroutines, from the overall step_budget for the adaptive
algorithm (user-specified through ``step_budget``). This determines the
number of trials at each rung (N in the above ASHA example).

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users specify configurations for the ``adaptive`` searcher through the
:ref:`experiment-configuration`. They fall into two categories described below.

**Parameters for ASHA:**

-  ``target_trial_steps``: The maximum number of steps that any one
   trial will be trained.
-  (optional, for advanced users only) ``divisor``: The multiplier for
   eliminating trials and increasing steps trained at each rung. The
   default is 4.
-  (optional, for advanced users only) ``max_rungs``: The maximum number
   of rungs. The default is 5.

**Parameters for adaptive mode:**

-  ``mode``: Options are ``aggressive``, ``standard``, or
   ``conservative``. Specifies how aggressively to perform early
   stopping. We suggest using either ``aggressive`` or ``standard``
   mode.
-  ``step_budget``: A budget for total steps taken across all trials and
   ASHA calls. The budget is split evenly between ASHA calls. The
   recommendation above was to set
   ``step_budget = 10 * target_trial_steps``.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

The table below illustrates the difference between ``aggressive``,
``standard``, and ``conservative`` for an otherwise fixed configuration.
While ``aggressive`` tries out 64 hyperparameter configurations,
``conservative`` tries only 31 hyperparameter configurations but has the
budget to run more of them to the full 16 steps. More ASHA instances are
generated by ``conservative``, which are responsible for creating the
trials run for the full 16 steps.

The settings are ``divisor: 4``, ``max_rungs: 3``,
``target_trial_steps: 16``, and ``step_budget: 160``.

FAQ
---

**Q: How do I control how many batches a trial is trained for before it
is potentially discarded?**

Two factors affect the number of batches a trial is guaranteed to be
trained on. The field :ref:`batches_per_step <batches-per-step>` affects how many
batches make up one step. The number of steps guaranteed is affected by
``target_trial_steps``, and is at least ``target_trial_steps / 256`` by
default, or ``target_trial_steps / divisor ^ (max_rungs-1)`` in general.

**Q: How do I set the initial number of trials? How do I make sure that a
certain number of trials are trained to completion?**

The number of initial trials is determined by a combination of ``mode``,
``step_budget``, ``divisor``, ``max_rungs``, and ``target_trial_steps``.
Here is a rule of thumb for the default configuration of
``max_rungs: 5`` and ``divisor: 4``, with ``mode: aggressive`` and a
large enough ``step_budget``:

-  The initial number of trials is
   ``step_budget / (4 * target_trial_steps)``.
-  To ensure that ``x`` trials are run ``target_trial_steps``, set
   ``step_budget`` to be ``4 * x * target_trial_steps``.

A configuration setting that meets set goals can also be found by trial
and error. The command

.. code:: bash

   det preview-search <file_name.yaml>

will display information on the number of trials versus number of steps for the
configuration specified in ``file_name.yaml``. Increasing ``step_budget``
increases both the initial number of trials and the number of trials that are
trained for the full number of steps. On the other hand, increasing
``target_trial_steps`` decreases both. The ``mode`` decides on allocation of
steps between trials; ``mode: conservative`` runs more trials for longer,
whereas ``mode: aggressive`` eliminates the most trials early in training.

**Q: The adaptive algorithm sounds great so far. What are its
weaknesses?**

One downside of adaptive is that it results in doing more validations,
which might be expensive.
