 Hyperparameter Search: Adaptive (Asynchronous)
################################################

The state-of-the-art ``adaptive_asha`` search method employs an
asynchronous version of successive halving (`ASHA
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05934.pdf>`_), which is suitable for
large-scale experiments with hundreds or thousands of trials.

*************
 Quick start
*************

Here are some suggested initial settings for ``adaptive_asha`` that
typically work well.

Search mode:

-  ``mode``: Set to ``standard``.

Resource budget:

-  ``max_length``: The maximum training length (see :ref:`Training Units
   <experiment-configuration_training_units>`) of any trial that
   survives to the end of the experiment. This quantity is
   domain-specific and should roughly reflect the number of minibatches
   the model must be trained on for it to converge on the data set. For
   users who would like to determine this number experimentally, train a
   model with reasonable hyperparameters using the ``single`` search
   method.

-  ``max_trials``: This indicates the total number of hyperparameter
   settings that will be evaluated in the experiment. Set ``max_trials``
   to at least 500 to take advantage of speedups from early-stopping.
   You can also set a large ``max_trials`` and stop the experiment once
   the desired performance is achieved.

-  ``max_concurrent_trials``: This field controls the degree of
   parallelism of the experiment. The experiment will have a maximum of
   this many trials training simultaneously at any one time. The
   ``adaptive_asha`` searcher scales nearly perfectly with additional
   compute, so you should set this field based on compute environment
   constraints. If this value is less than the number of brackets
   produced by the adaptive algorithm, it will be rounded up.

Conceptually, the ``adaptive_asha`` searcher is a carefully tuned
strategy for spawning multiple *ASHA* (asynchronous successive halving
algorithm) searchers, themselves hyperparameter search algorithms. ASHA
can be configured to make different tradeoffs between exploration and
exploitation, i.e., how many trials are explored versus how long a
single trial is trained for. Because the right tradeoff between
exploration and exploitation is hard to know in advance, the
``adaptive_asha`` algorithm tries several ASHA searches with different
tradeoffs.

The configuration settings available to Determined experiments running
in ``adaptive_asha`` mode mostly affect the ASHA subroutines directly.
The ``mode`` configuration is the only one affecting the decisions of
the ``adaptive_asha`` searcher, by changing the number and types of ASHA
subroutines spawned.

The first section here gives a description of the synchronous version of
ASHA called successive halving. The second section discusses the
motivation for the asynchronous promotions used by ASHA. The third
section describes why you would choose adaptive_asha over plain
asynchronous_halving. The final section and conclusion is a set of FAQs
regarding ``adaptive_asha``.

ASHA
====

At a high level, SHA prunes ("halves") a set of trials in successive
rounds we call *rungs*. SHA starts with an initial set of trials. (A
trial means one model, with a fixed set of hyperparameter values.) SHA
trains all the trials for some length and the trials with the worst
validation performance are discarded. In the next rung, the remaining
trials are trained for a longer period of time, and then trials with the
worst validation performance are pruned once again. This is repeated
until the maximum training length is reached.

First, an example of SHA.

-  Rung 1: SHA creates N initial trials; the hyperparameter values for
   each trial are randomly sampled from the hyperparameters defined in
   the experiment configuration file. Each trial is trained for 1 epoch,
   and then validation metrics are computed.

-  Rung 2: SHA picks the N/4 top-performing trials according to
   validation metrics. These are trained for 4 epochs.

-  Rung 3: SHA picks the N/16 top-performing trials according to
   validation metrics. These are trained for 16 epochs.

At the end, the trial with best performance has the hyperparameter
setting the SHA searcher returns.

In the example above, we generalize "halving" with a field called
divisor, which determines what fraction of trials are kept in successive
rungs, as well as the training length in successive rungs.
``max_length`` is 16 epochs, which is the maximum length a trial is
trained for.

In general, SHA has a fixed ``divisor`` d. In the first rung, it
generates an initial set of randomly chosen trials and runs until each
trial has trained for the same length. In the next rung, it keeps 1/d of
those trials and closes the rest. Then it runs each remaining trial
until it has trained for d times as long as the previous rung. ASHA
iterates this process until some stopping criterion is reached, such as
completing a specified number of rungs or having only one trial
remaining. The total training length, rungs, and trials within rungs are
fixed within each SHA searcher, but vary across different calls to SHA
by the adaptive algorithm. Note that although the name "SHA" includes
the phrase "halving", the fraction of trials pruned after every rung is
controlled by ``divisor``.

Why Asynchronous Halving?
=========================

Successive halving (SHA) promotes hyperparameter configurations
synchronously, waiting for each rung to complete before performing any
promotions. This allows the algorithm to have complete information about
all trials at the time of promotion, but it results in underutilized
nodes waiting on completion of validation steps for other
configurations. ASHA, asynchronous successive halving, asynchronously
promotes trials when it has the minimum information required to make a
decision in order to maximize compute efficiency of the searcher. In
contrast to SHA which initializes all trials in the bottom rung at the
outset, ASHA will continuously add trials to the bottom rung until the
desired number of trials is reached.

See the difference in asynchronous vs. sychronous promotions in the two
animated GIFs below:

Adaptive over ASHA
==================

The adaptive algorithm calls ASHA subroutines with varying parameters.
The exact calls are configured through the choice of ``mode``, which
specifies how aggressively to perform early stopping. One way to think
about this behavior is as a spectrum that ranges from "one ASHA run"
(aggressive early stopping; eliminate most trials every rung) to
"``searcher: random``" "multiple ASHA runs, some of which will not early
stop and others will early stop later" (try some without early stopping;
initialized trials may be allowed to run to completion).

On one end, ``aggressive`` applies early stopping in a very eager
manner; this mode essentially corresponds to only making a single call
to ASHA. With the default ``divisor`` of 4, 75% of the remaining trials
will be eliminated in each rung after only being trained for 25% the
length of the next rung. This implies that relatively few trials will be
allowed to finish even a small fraction of the length needed train to
convergence (``max_length``). This aggressive early stopping behavior
allows the searcher to start more trials for a wider exploration of
hyperparameter configurations, at the risk of discarding a configuration
too soon.

On the other end, ``conservative`` mode is more similar to a ``random``
search, in that it performs significantly less pruning. Extra ASHA
subroutines are spawned with fewer rungs and longer training lengths to
account for the high percentage of trials eliminated after only a short
time. However, a ``conservative`` adaptive search will only explore a
small fraction of the configurations explored by an ``aggressive``
search, given the same budget.

Once the number and types of calls to ASHA are determined (via
``mode``), the adaptive algorithm will allocate training length budgets
to the ASHA subroutines, from the overall budget for the adaptive
algorithm (user-specified through ``budget``). This determines the
number of trials at each rung (N in the above ASHA example).

 FAQ
*****

**Q: How do I control how long a trial is trained for before it is
potentially discarded?**

The training length is guaranteed to be at least ``max_length / 256`` by
default, or ``max_length / divisor ^ max_rungs-1`` in general. It is
recommended to configure this in records or epochs if the
``global_batch_size`` hyperparameter is not constant, to ensure each
trial trains on the same amount of data.

**Q: How do I make sure ``x`` trials are run the full training length
(``max_length``)?**

The number of initial trials is determined by a combination of ``mode``,
``max_trials``, ``divisor``, ``max_rungs``, ``max_length`` and
``bracket_rungs``. Here is a rule of thumb for the default configuration
of ``max_rungs: 5`` and ``divisor: 4``, with ``mode: standard`` and a
large enough ``max_trials``:

-  The initial number of trials is ``max_trials``.

-  To ensure that ``x`` trials are run ``max_length``, set
   ``max_trials`` high enough for the brackets with their halving rate
   (the ``divisor``) to allow ``x`` trials to make it to the final
   ``rungs``. This can be viewed by the command describe below.

A configuration setting that meets set goals can be found by trial and
error. The command

.. code:: bash

   det preview-search <file_name.yaml>

will display information on the number of trials versus training length
for the configuration specified in ``file_name.yaml``.

**Q: The adaptive algorithm sounds great so far. What are its
weaknesses?**

In our experience, early-stopping works well across a variety of deep
learning models. However, there may be some search spaces in which
early-stopping underperforms simple random search. This can happen if
model complexity varies drastically in a search space leading to
different converge rates or if the search space contains hyperparameters
that are strongly correlated with training length.
