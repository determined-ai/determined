Hyperparameter Search: Adaptive (Simple)
========================================

The ``adaptive_simple`` searcher takes two intuitive configuration options
capturing how many configurations to search and a maximum resource budget
allowed per configuration:

-  ``max_trials``: The maximum number of hyperparameter configurations
   that will be explored. Most of these configurations will *not* be
   trained to convergence; rather, the search method will use
   early-stopping to prune hyperparameter configurations that are not
   performing well.
-  ``max_steps``: The maximum number of steps that any trial that
   survives to the end of the experiment will be trained for (a *step* is a
   :ref:`fixed number <batches-per-step>` of batches). This quantity is
   domain-specific and should roughly reflect the number of training steps
   needed for the model to converge on the data set. For users who would like to
   determine this number experimentally, train a model with reasonable
   hyperparameters using the :ref:`single<topic-guides_hp-tuning-det_single>`
   search method.
