 Hyperparameter Search: Adaptive (Simple)
##########################################

Note: Adaptive (Simple) will be deprecated. We recommend users to use
the state-of-the-art Adaptive (ASHA) searcher.

The ``adaptive_simple`` searcher takes two intuitive configuration
options capturing how many configurations to search and a maximum
resource budget allowed per configuration:

-  ``max_trials``: The maximum number of hyperparameter configurations
   that will be explored. Most of these configurations will *not* be
   trained to convergence; rather, the search method will use
   early-stopping to prune hyperparameter configurations that are not
   performing well.

-  ``max_length``: The maximum training length (see :ref:`Training Units
   <experiment-configuration_training_units>`) of any trial that
   survives to the end of the experiment. This quantity is
   domain-specific and should roughly reflect the training length needed
   for the model to converge on the data set. For users who would like
   to determine this number experimentally, train a model with
   reasonable hyperparameters using the :ref:`single
   <topic-guides_hp-tuning-det_single>` search method.
