YAML Topic Guide
================

YAML is a markup language often used for configuration. In Determined, we use YAML
for configuring tasks such as experiments and notebooks, as well as :ref:`configuring
the Determined cluster <cluster-configuration>`.

Overview
--------

Key-Value Pairs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At its core, YAML is a set of key-value pairs. These pairs are written like
``key: value``. We use snake-case for words in Determined. The values in a YAML file
can be ints, floats, booleans, strings, or more complex types like maps and
arrays.


Maps
~~~~
Maps represent hierarchical relationships of keys and values. Maps in YAML are
represented by providing additional key-value pairs as the value of a
particular key. Maps can be nested and combined with other YAML structures like
arrays. Indents should be two spaces.

We use a map in the experiment configuration to configure hyperparameters:

.. code:: yaml

  hyperparameters:
    base_learning_rate: 0.001
    weight_cost: 0.0001
    global_batch_size: 64
    n_filters1: 40
    n_filters2: 40

Arrays
~~~~~~
We use arrays to provide multiple values for a given key. In arrays, each value
is on its own line and is preceded by a ``-`` and a space. Arrays can be nested
and combined with other YAML structures like maps.

We use an array in the experiment configuration to configure environment
variables:

.. code:: yaml

  environment:
    environment_variables:
      - A=A
      - B=B
      - C=C


Putting It All Together
-----------------------
Configurations usually use some combination of key-value pairs, maps, and
arrays. In this example experiment configuration, we use key-value pairs,
floats, integers, strings, a map, and an array:

.. code:: yaml

  description: mnist_tf_const
  data:
    base_url: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/determined-ai-datasets/mnist/
    training_data: train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
    training_labels: train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
    validation_set_size: 10000
  hyperparameters:
    base_learning_rate: 0.001
    weight_cost: 0.0001
    global_batch_size: 64
    n_filters1: 40
    n_filters2: 40
  searcher:
    name: single
    metric: error
    max_length:
      batches: 500
    smaller_is_better: true
  environment:
    environment_variables:
      - A=A
      - B=B
      - C=C
