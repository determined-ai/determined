OAuth 2.0 (Enterprise Edition)
==============================

Determined EE allows requests to certain endpoints to be authenticated
using OAuth 2.0 with the authorization code flow. Currently, only the
SCIM endpoints are supported.

Configuration
-------------

To enable OAuth support, set ``scim.auth.type`` to ``oauth`` in the
Determined :ref:`master configuration <master-configuration>`.

The values you'll need to configure an OAuth client application are as
follows:

-  The authorization endpoint, which is the hostname of the Determined
   master followed by ``/oauth2/authorize``.

-  The access token endpoint, which is the hostname of the Determined
   master followed by ``/oauth2/token``.

-  The client ID and secret, which are obtained using the Determined
   CLI:

   .. code::

      det oauth client add <descriptive client name> <domain of redirect URI>
      # For example:
      det oauth client add okta https://system-admin.okta.com

   The output of that command will look like the following:

   .. code::

      Client ID:     5d9bb6c1b423215f7eb0d719fffb39dda2d0d864252389da5061615d8da6887a
      Client secret: 37e96a2a27e20004477dbdc60c2143ee984817bc6b3a0016182a2fc15707b9c2

   .. warning::

      There is no other way to obtain the secret. Make sure not to lose
      it before configuring your client.

Management
----------

The CLI also provides these commands for listing and removing OAuth
clients after they have been added:

.. code::

   det oauth client list
   det oauth client remove <client ID>
