 System Architecture

Determined consists of a single **master** and one or more **agents**.
There is typically one agent per compute server; a single machine can
serve as both a master and an agent.

The master is responsible for

-  Storing experiment, trial, and workload metadata.
-  Scheduling and dispatching work to agents.
-  Advancing the experiment, trial, workload state machines over time.

Each agent manages a number of **slots**, which represent computing
devices, typically one slot per CPU or GPU. On startup the agent sends
the master the devices it has available. It then waits for messages from
the master and runs the requested workloads; agents have no state and
otherwise do not communicate with the master.

A slot executes its workload in a containerized environment called the
**trial runner**. We provide standard Docker containers to run typical
deep learning workloads; containers can be customized for specific
needs. Trial runners are expected to have access to the training data.

The trial runner runs **workloads**, which may be training a trial,
evaluating a trial on a validation dataset, or other operations like
checkpointing model state. The master may then send more workloads or
terminate the trial runner (freeing the slot). When sending a workload
to the trial runner, the master consults with the searcher to determine
which workload to run next.
