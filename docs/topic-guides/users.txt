#######
 Users
#######

Determined is designed for teams of machine learning developers. Any
entity (such as an experiment or a notebook) is visible to all users on
the same installation of Determined, regardless of who created it.

*****************
 Getting Started
*****************

Initially, a Determined installation has two user accounts: ``admin``
and ``determined``. Both of these accounts have blank passwords by
default.

The ``admin`` user has the sole privilege to create users, change other
users' passwords, and activate/deactivate users.

Use ``det user change-password`` via the CLI to set a password for the
``admin`` user. This is highly encouraged for new installs.

.. code::

   det -u admin user change-password

The ``determined`` user is designed for ease of use on a single-user
installation. However, teams will benefit from creating a Determined
user account for each individual. Namely, having individual user
accounts provides clearer authorship and improved filtering of entities.
To create users in a Determined installation, use the ``admin`` user to
create user accounts for each individual that would like to use
Determined:

.. code::

   det -u admin user create <username>

Then, the ``determined`` user can be deactivated:

.. code::

   det -u admin user deactivate determined

This ensures that no one can access the Determined cluster as the
``determined`` user (any objects that were created by this user will
remain).

****************
 Authentication
****************

WebUI
=====

The WebUI will automatically redirect users to a login page if there is
no valid Determined session established on that browser. After logging
in, the user will be redirected to the URL they initially attempted to
access.

A browser Determined session can be ended by clicking "Sign Out" under
the user menu in the top right of the WebUI.

CLI
===

In the CLI, the ``user login`` subcommand can be used to authenticate a
user:

.. code::

   det user login <username>

Logging in results in a persistent session, which lasts for 30 days. The
session can be terminated using:

.. code::

   det user logout

Temporary authentication
------------------------

In some cases, it may be useful to execute a single command as a
specific user without starting a persistent session for that user (think
of the ``sudo`` command on a Unix-like system). In Determined, this can
be achieved with the ``-u`` flag:

.. code::

   det -u <username> ...

This will execute the command as the given user without creating a
permanent session for that user. Although no persistent session is
created, an authentication token is stored for that user so that future
attempts to execute commands as that user will not require
re-authenticating. This token can be discarded using the ``user logout``
subcommand:

.. code::

   det -u <username> user logout

********************
 Changing passwords
********************

Users have blank passwords by default. This might be sufficient for
low-security or experimental clusters, and it still provides the
organizational benefits of associating each Determined object with the
user that created it. If desired, a user can change their own password
using the ``user change-password`` subcommand:

.. code::

   det user change-password

An admin can also change another user's password:

.. code::

   det -u admin user change-password <target-user>

.. warning::

   Although Determined supports password-based authentication,
   communication between the CLI, WebUI, and master does *not* take
   place over an encrypted channel by default. See :ref:`security` for
   information on configuring secure connections over HTTPS. Users
   should not be assigned "valuable" passwords, and passwords used with
   Determined should not be reused for other purposes.

****************
 Listing assets
****************

.. _cli-1:

CLI
===

When using the CLI to list experiments, commands, etc., the default
behavior is to only show assets belonging to the current user. It is
possible to show assets owned by all users by passing the ``-a`` flag to
the respective commands:

.. code::

   det experiment list -a   # List all experiments.
   det command list -a      # List all commands.
   det notebook list -a     # List all notebooks.
   det tensorboard list -a  # List all TensorBoards.

.. _webui-1:

WebUI
=====

Just as in the CLI, by default the WebUI will only show assets created
by the current user. To see assets belonging to all users, uncheck the
"Show only mine" checkbox in the filter panel found in the tab for each
asset type.

*******************************
 Activating/deactivating users
*******************************

When a user is created, they are designated as active by default. Only
active users can interact with Determined. The ``admin`` user can
deactivate a user with the ``user deactivate`` subcommand:

.. code::

   det -u admin user deactivate <target-user>

All assets created by a deactivated user will remain available through
both the WebUI and the CLI.

To reactivate a user, ``user activate`` can be used:

.. code::

   det -u admin user activate <target-user>

.. _run-as-user:

*****************************************
 Running tasks as particular agent users
*****************************************

If an experiment, notebook, or command task uses the ``bind_mount``
option in its :ref:`experiment-configuration`, it is often useful to set
the Unix user and group on the agent that the task runs as. This allows
the file permissions on the agent to be reflected in the task and vice
versa.

This can be configured by linking a Determined user with the user and
group configuration on an agent:

.. code::

   det user link-with-agent-user <target-user> --agent-uid <uid> --agent-user <username> --agent-gid <gid> --agent-group <group-name>

All arguments are required. This command can only be run by a system
administrator.

Once set, any tasks created by the target user will be run as the
specified user and group.

.. note::

   By default, if a user is not linked with a user and group on an
   agent, tasks created by that user will run as the root user on the
   agent. This behavior may change in the future.

   If the task does not use `bind_mount` option, the effect of running
   as root will be limited to the task container and not intrude on the
   agent itself.

The default user and group that will be used when a Determined user is
not explicitly linked to a user and group on an agent can be configured
in the ``master.yaml`` file located at ``/usr/local/determined/etc`` on
the Determined master instance:

.. code:: yaml

   security:
     default_task:
       user: root
       uid: 0
       group: root
       gid: 0

***************************************
 Running unprivileged tasks by default
***************************************

Some administrators of Determined may wish to run tasks as unprivileged
users by default. In Linux, unprivileged processes are sometimes run
under the `nobody <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_(username)>`_
user, which has very few privileges. However, the ``nobody`` user does
not have a writable ``HOME`` directory, which causes problems for some
common tools like ``gsutil``.

For convenience, the default Determined environments contain an
unprivileged user named ``det-nobody``, which does have a writable
``HOME`` directory. The ``det-nobody`` user is a suitable default user
when using the default Determined environment images and when running
containers as root is not desired. To use ``det-nobody`` by default, add
the following configuration to ``master.yaml``:

.. code:: yaml

   security:
     default_task:
       user: det-nobody
       uid: 65533
       group: det-nobody
       gid: 65533

When combining the ``det-nobody`` user with custom Docker images,
administrators should either build the custom image as layers on top of
the default Determined Environments as illustrated in
:ref:`custom-docker-images`, or they should create the ``det-nobody``
user themselves in their custom images using ``groupadd`` and
``useradd``.
