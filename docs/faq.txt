Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Installation
------------

How do I install the CLI?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

   pip install determined-cli

For more details, see the :ref:`installation instructions <install-cli>`.

When trying to install the Determined command-line interface, I encounter this ``distutils`` error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

   Uninstalling a distutils installed project (...) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially uninstall the project.

If a Python library has previously been installed in your environment with
`distutils <https://docs.python.org/3/library/distutils.html>`__ or `conda
<https://conda.io/en/latest/>`__, ``pip`` may not be able to upgrade or
downgrade the library to the version required by Determined. There are two
recommended solutions:

#. Install the Determined command-line interface into a fresh
   `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ with no
   previous Python packages installed.

#. Use ``--ignore-installed`` with ``pip`` to force overwriting the library
   version(s).

   .. code:: bash

      pip install --ignore-installed determined-cli

Packages and Containers
-----------------------

How do I install Python packages that my model code depends on?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, workloads execute inside a Determined-provided container
that includes common deep learning libraries and frameworks. If your
model code has additional dependencies, the easiest way to install them
is to specify a container :ref:`startup hook <startup-hooks>`. For more
complex dependencies, you can also use a :ref:`custom Docker image
<custom-docker-images>`.

Can I use a custom container image?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes; see the documentation on :ref:`custom Docker images
<custom-docker-images>` for details.

Can I use Determined with a private Docker Registry?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes: specify the registry path as part of the custom image name. See the
documentation on :ref:`custom Docker images <custom-docker-images>` for
more details.

Experiment Management
---------------------

What happens when an experiment is archived?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Archiving is designed to make it easier to organize experiments by omitting
information about experiment runs that are no longer relevant (e.g., training
jobs that failed with an error or jobs submitted as part of the model
development process).

When an experiment is archived, it is hidden from the default view in both the
WebUI and the CLI, but all of the metadata associated with the experiment
(including checkpoints) is preserved. An experiment can subsequently be
unarchived if desired, without losing any of the experiment's
metadata.

How can I delete model checkpoints that are no longer useful?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to delete a checkpoint is to modify the garbage collection policy
of the experiment that created the checkpoint. For example, to delete *all* of
the experiments associated with an experiment, run:

.. code::

    det experiment set gc-policy --save-experiment-best 0 --save-trial-best 0 --save-trial-latest 0 <experiment-id>

Multi-GPU Training
------------------

Why do my multi-GPU training experiments never start?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It might be that :ref:`slots_per_trial <exp-config-resources-slots-per-trial>`
in the experiment configuration is not a multiple of the number of GPUs on a
machine or that there are running tasks preventing your multi-GPU trials from
acquiring all the GPUs on a single machine. Consider adjusting
``slots_per_trial`` or terminating existing tasks to free up slots in your
cluster.

See :ref:`multi-gpu-training` for more details.

Why do my multi-machine training experiments appear to be stuck?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multi-machine training requires that all machines be able to connect to
each other directly. There may be firewall rules or network
configuration that prevent machines in your cluster from communicating.
Please check if agent machines can access each other outside of Determined
(e.g., using the ``ping`` or ``netcat`` tools).

More rarely, if agents have multiple network interfaces and some of them
are not routable, Determined may pick one of those interfaces rather than one
that allows one agent to contact another. In this case, it is possible
to set the network interface used for multi-GPU training explicitly in
the :ref:`cluster-configuration`.


TensorFlow Support
------------------

Can I train a Tensorflow Core model in Determined?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Determined has support for TensorFlow models that use the :ref:`tf.keras <tf-keras-trial>`
or :ref:`Estimator <estimator-trial>` APIs. For models that use the low-level TensorFlow
Core APIs, we recommend porting your model to use :ref:`Estimator Trial <estimator-trial>`.
