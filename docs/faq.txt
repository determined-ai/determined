**************
 Installation
**************

How do I install the CLI?
=========================

.. code:: bash

   pip install determined

For more details, see the :ref:`installation instructions
<install-cli>`.

When trying to install the Determined command-line interface, I encounter this ``distutils`` error
==================================================================================================

.. code::

   Uninstalling a distutils installed project (...) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially uninstall the project.

If a Python library has previously been installed in your environment
with `distutils <https://docs.python.org/3/library/distutils.html>`__ or
`conda <https://conda.io/en/latest/>`__, ``pip`` may not be able to
upgrade or downgrade the library to the version required by Determined.
There are two recommended solutions:

#. Install the Determined command-line interface into a fresh
   `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ with no
   previous Python packages installed.

#. Use ``--ignore-installed`` with ``pip`` to force overwriting the
   library version(s).

   .. code:: bash

      pip install --ignore-installed determined-cli

Is it possible to install Determined on Kubernetes?
===================================================

Yes; please see :ref:`Installing Determined on Kubernetes
<install-on-kubernetes>` for details.

After installing Determined on Kubernetes, I can't reach the Determined master
==============================================================================

Useful steps for debugging this include:

.. code:: bash

   # Get the name of the Helm deployment.
   helm list

   # Double check the IP address and port assigned to the Determined master by looking up the master service.
   kubectl get service determined-master-service-development-<helm deployment name>

   # Check the status of master deployment.
   kubectl describe deployment determined-master-deployment-<helm deployment name>

   # Check the logs of master pod.
   kubectl logs <determined-master-pod-name>

Please see :ref:`useful-kubectl-commands` for more debugging tips.

When installing Determined on Kubernetes, I get an ``ImagePullBackOff`` error
=============================================================================

You may be trying to install a non-released version of Determined or a
version in a private registry without the right secret. Please see the
documentation on how to configure which :ref:`version of Determined
<configure-determined-kubernetes-version>` to install on Kubernetes.

After upgrading Determined and trying to use the CLI, I get ``det: command not found`` error
============================================================================================

When upgrading from a version earlier than 0.15.0, some users may need
to uninstall Determined and then install it again by running:

.. code::

   pip uninstall -y determined-common determined determined-cli determined-deploy
   pip install determined

*************************
 Packages and Containers
*************************

How do I install Python packages that my model code depends on?
===============================================================

By default, workloads execute inside a Determined-provided container
that includes common deep learning libraries and frameworks. If your
model code has additional dependencies, the easiest way to install them
is to specify a container :ref:`startup hook <startup-hooks>`. For more
complex dependencies, you can also use a :ref:`custom Docker image
<custom-docker-images>`.

Can I use a custom container image?
===================================

Yes; see the documentation on :ref:`custom Docker images
<custom-docker-images>` for details.

Can I use Determined with a private Docker Registry?
====================================================

Yes: specify the registry path as part of the custom image name. See the
documentation on :ref:`custom Docker images <custom-docker-images>` for
more details.

***********************
 Experiment Management
***********************

What happens when an experiment is archived?
============================================

Archiving is designed to make it easier to organize experiments by
omitting information about experiment runs that are no longer relevant
(e.g., training jobs that failed with an error or jobs submitted as part
of the model development process).

When an experiment is archived, it is hidden from the default view in
both the WebUI and the CLI, but all of the metadata associated with the
experiment (including checkpoints) is preserved. An experiment can
subsequently be unarchived if desired, without losing any of the
experiment's metadata.

How can I delete model checkpoints that are no longer useful?
=============================================================

The best way to delete a checkpoint is to modify the garbage collection
policy of the experiment that created the checkpoint. For example, to
delete *all* of the experiments associated with an experiment, run:

.. code::

   det experiment set gc-policy --save-experiment-best 0 --save-trial-best 0 --save-trial-latest 0 <experiment-id>

**********************
 Distributed Training
**********************

Why do my distributed training experiments never start?
=======================================================

If :ref:`slots_per_trial <exp-config-resources-slots-per-trial>` is
greater than the number of slots on a single agent, Determined will
schedule it over multiple machines. When scheduling a multi-machine
distributed training job, Determined requires that the job uses all of
the slots (GPUs) on an agent. For example, in a cluster that consists of
8-GPU agents, an experiment with :ref:`slots_per_trial
<exp-config-resources-slots-per-trial>` set to ``12`` will never be
scheduled and will instead wait indefinitely. The :ref:`distributed
training documentation <dtrain-scheduling>` describes this scheduling
behavior in more detail.

There may also be running tasks preventing your multi-GPU trials from
acquiring enough GPUs on a single machine. Consider adjusting
``slots_per_trial`` or terminating existing tasks to free up slots in
your cluster.

Why do my multi-machine training experiments appear to be stuck?
================================================================

Multi-machine training requires that all machines are able to connect to
each other directly. There may be firewall rules or network
configuration that prevent machines in your cluster from communicating.
Please check if agent machines can access each other outside of
Determined (e.g., using the ``ping`` or ``netcat`` tools).

More rarely, if agents have multiple network interfaces and some of them
are not routable, Determined may pick one of those interfaces rather
than one that allows one agent to contact another. In this case, it is
possible to set the network interface used for distributed training
explicitly in the :ref:`cluster-configuration`.

************
 Scheduling
************

How can I control which agents a task is scheduled on?
======================================================

Agents can now be grouped into multiple resource pools and tasks can be
assigned to specific resource pools. For more information, please see
:ref:`resource-pools`.

********************
 TensorFlow Support
********************

Can I use TensorFlow Core models with Determined?
=================================================

Determined has support for TensorFlow models that use the :ref:`tf.keras
<tf-keras-trial>` or :ref:`Estimator <estimator-trial>` APIs. For models
that use the low-level TensorFlow Core APIs, we recommend porting your
model to use :ref:`Estimator Trial <estimator-trial>`. `Example of
converting a TensorFlow graph into an Estimator
<https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/blob/master/examples/computer_vision/mnist_tf_layers/model_def.py>`_.

Can I use TensorFlow 2 with Determined?
=======================================

Yes; Determined supports both TensorFlow 1 and 2. The version of
TensorFlow that is used for a particular experiment is controlled by the
container image that has been configured for that experiment. Determined
provides prebuilt Docker images that include TensorFlow 1.15, and 2.4,
respectively:

-  ``determinedai/environments:cuda-10.2-pytorch-1.7-tf-1.15-gpu-0.12.0``
   (default)
-  ``determinedai/environments:cuda-11.0-pytorch-1.7-lightning-1.2-tf-2.4-gpu-0.12.0``

To change the container image used for an experiment, specify
:ref:`environment.image <exp-environment-image>` in the experiment
configuration file. Please see :ref:`container-images` for more details
about configuring training environments and a more complete list of
prebuilt Docker images.

How do I debug a TensorFlow model inside Determined?
====================================================

Please see :ref:`model-debug`.

*****************
 PyTorch Support
*****************

How do I debug a PyTorch model inside Determined?
=================================================

Please see :ref:`model-debug`.

Why am I seeing significantly different metrics for trials which are paused and later continued than trials which aren't paused?
================================================================================================================================

When a trial is paused, the current state of the trial is saved to a
:ref:`checkpoint <exporting-checkpoints>`. When the trial later resumes
training, Determined will reload the state of the model from the most
recent checkpoint. If you observe that this process degrades the model's
training or validation metrics (compared to a model trained on the same
data without interruption), one explanation is that the model's state
might not be restored accurately or completely from the checkpoint. When
using PyTorch, this can sometimes happen if the PyTorch API is not used
correctly.

Please verify the following in the model code:

-  The model is wrapped with :meth:`wrap_model
   <determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext.wrap_model>`.

-  The optimizer is wrapped with :meth:`wrap_optimizer
   <determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext.wrap_optimizer>` and based on
   the output of ``wrap_model``, not the original unwrapped model.

-  The LR scheduler is wrapped with :meth:`wrap_lr_scheduler
   <determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext.wrap_lr_scheduler>` and based
   on the output of ``wrap_optimizer``, not the original unwrapped
   optimizer.

*********************
 TensorBoard Support
*********************

Can I log additional TensorBoard events beyond what Determined logs automatically?
==================================================================================

Yes; any additional TFEvent files that are written to
``/tmp/tensorboard`` inside a trial container will be accessible via
TensorBoard. For example, to log a custom TensorBoard event using
PyTorch:

.. code:: python

   from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

   writer = SummaryWriter(log_dir="/tmp/tensorboard")
   writer.add_scalar("my_metric", np.random.random(), batch_idx)

For more details, as well as examples of how to do this with TF
Estimator and TF Keras models, refer to the :ref:`TensorBoard How-To
Guide <data-in-tensorboard>`.

Can I use TensorBoard with PyTorch?
===================================

Yes! For an example of this check out the :download:`mnist-GAN
</examples/gan_mnist_pytorch.tgz>` example. This model uses the
:class:`~determined.tensorboard.metric_writers.pytorch.TorchWriter`
class which automatically configures the location for writing
TensorBoards. Users can also directly use
``torch.utils.tensorboard.SummaryWriter`` as shown in the snippet above.

************************
 Ecosystem Integrations
************************

How can I use Determined with Spark, Airflow, or Pachyderm?
===========================================================

Determined is focused on helping teams of deep learning engineers train
better models more quickly. However, Determined is also designed to
easily integrate with other popular ML ecosystem tools for tasks that
are related to model training, such as ETL, ML pipelines, and model
serving. The `Works with Determined
<https://github.com/determined-ai/works-with-determined>`__ repository
includes examples of how to use Determined with a variety of ML
ecosystem tools, including Pachyderm, DVC, Delta Lake, Seldon, Spark,
Argo, Airflow, and Kubeflow.
