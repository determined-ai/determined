Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Installation
------------

Which dependencies are required to install the Determined command-line interface?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need to have Python >= 3.5 and ``pip`` installed in your
development environment. If you need to install a new version of Python,
one tool you can use is `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`__.

How do I install the Determined command-line interface?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

   pip install determined-cli

When trying to install the Determined command-line interface, I encounter this ``distutils`` error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

   Uninstalling a distutils installed project (...) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially uninstall the project.

If a Python library has previously been installed in your environment with
`distutils <https://docs.python.org/3/library/distutils.html>`__ or `conda
<https://conda.io/en/latest/>`__, ``pip`` may not be able to upgrade or
downgrade the library to the version required by Determined. There are two
recommended solutions:

#. Install the Determined command-line interface into a fresh
   `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ with no
   previous Python packages installed.

#. Use ``--ignore-installed`` with ``pip`` to force overwriting the library
   version(s).

   .. code:: bash

      pip install --ignore-installed determined-cli

Multi-GPU Training
------------------

Why do my multi-GPU training experiments never start?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It might be that ``slots_per_trial`` in the experiment configuration is
not a multiple of the number of GPUs on a machine or that there are
running tasks preventing your multi-GPU trials from acquiring all the
GPUs on a single machine. Consider adjusting ``slots_per_trial`` or
terminating existing tasks to free up slots in your cluster.

See :ref:`multi-gpu-training` for more details.

Why do my multi-machine training experiments appear to be stuck?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multi-machine training requires that all machines be able to connect to
each other directly. There may be firewall rules or network
configuration that prevent machines in your cluster from communicating.
Please check if agent machines can access each other outside of Determined
(e.g., using the ``ping`` or ``netcat`` tools).

More rarely, if agents have multiple network interfaces and some of them
are not routable, Determined may pick one of those interfaces rather than one
that allows one agent to contact another. In this case, it is possible
to set the network interface used for multi-GPU training explicitly in
the :ref:`cluster-configuration`.
