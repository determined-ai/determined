 Interact with Cluster
#######################

To interact with a Determined cluster, there are many ways to do that.

********
 Basics
********

Typically, you need to use the WebUI and the CLI.

The WebUI allows users to create and monitor the progress of experiments. It is accessible by
visiting ``http://master-addr:8080``, where ``master-addr`` is the hostname or IP address where the
Determined master is running.

The :ref:`command-line interface (CLI) <cli>` is distributed as a Python wheel package; once the
wheel has been installed, the CLI can be used via the ``det`` command.

************
 Automation
************

In order to automate some operations, you can use the Python APIs and the REST APIs. The
:ref:`Python APIs <client>` define a Pythonic way to access the cluster. The :ref:`REST APIs
<rest-api>` provide a way for users and external tools to interact with a Determined cluster
programmatically.
