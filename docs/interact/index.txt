 Interact with Cluster
#######################

To interact with a Determined cluster, there are many ways to do that.

*******
 WebUI
*******

The WebUI allows users to create and monitor the progress of experiments. It is accessible by
visiting ``http://master-addr:8080``, where ``master-addr`` is the hostname or IP address where the
Determined master is running.

*****
 CLI
*****

The :ref:`command-line interface (CLI) <cli>` is distributed as a Python wheel package; once the
wheel has been installed, the CLI can be used via the ``det`` command.

***********
 REST APIs
***********

The :ref:`REST APIs <rest-api>` provide a way for users and external tools to interact with a
Determined cluster programmatically.

*************
 Python APIs
*************

The :ref:`Python APIs <client>` defines a Pythonic way to access the cluster.
