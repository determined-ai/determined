 Installation

Users can also interact with Determined using a command-line interface. The CLI is distributed as a
Python wheel package; once the wheel has been installed (see :ref:`install-cli` for details), the
CLI can be used via the ``det`` command.

Each ML engineer that wants to use Determined should install a copy of the Determined CLI on their
local development machine. The CLI can be installed via ``pip``:

.. code::

   pip install determined

The CLI requires Python >= 3.6. We suggest installing the CLI into a `virtualenv
<https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__, although this is optional. To install the CLI into a
virtualenv, first activate the virtualenv and then type the command above.

After the CLI has been installed, it should be configured to connect to the Determined master at the
appropriate IP address. This can be accomplished by setting the ``DET_MASTER`` environment variable:

.. code::

   export DET_MASTER=<master IP>

You may want to place this into the appropriate configuration file for your login shell (e.g.,
``.bashrc``).

More information about using the Determined CLI can be found in the :ref:`reference documentation
<cli>` or by running ``det --help``.

When trying to install the Determined command-line interface, I encounter this ``distutils`` error
==================================================================================================

.. code::

   Uninstalling a distutils installed project (...) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially uninstall the project.

If a Python library has previously been installed in your environment with `distutils
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/distutils.html>`__ or `conda <https://conda.io/en/latest/>`__,
``pip`` may not be able to upgrade or downgrade the library to the version required by Determined.
There are two recommended solutions:

#. Install the Determined command-line interface into a fresh `virtualenv
   <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ with no previous Python packages installed.

#. Use ``--ignore-installed`` with ``pip`` to force overwriting the library version(s).

   .. code:: bash

      pip install --ignore-installed determined-cli

After upgrading Determined and trying to use the CLI, I get ``det: command not found`` error
============================================================================================

When upgrading from a version earlier than 0.15.0, some users may need to uninstall Determined and
then install it again by running:

.. code::

   pip uninstall -y determined-common determined determined-cli determined-deploy
   pip install determined

*******
 Usage
*******

CLI subcommands usually follow a ``<noun> <verb>`` form, similar to the paradigm of `ip
<http://www.policyrouting.org/iproute2.doc.html>`__. Certain abbreviations are supported, and a
missing verb is the same as ``list``, when possible.

For example, the different commands within each of the blocks below all do the same thing:

.. code:: bash

   # List all experiments.
   $ det experiment list
   $ det e list
   $ det e

.. code:: bash

   # List all agents.
   $ det agent list
   $ det a list
   $ det a

.. code:: bash

   # List all slots.
   $ det slot list
   $ det slot
   $ det s

For a complete description of the available nouns and abbreviations, see the output of ``det help``.
Each noun also provides a ``help`` verb that describes the possible verbs for that noun. Or you can
provide ``-h`` or ``--help`` as an argument anywhere will cause the CLI to exit after printing help
text for the object or action specified up to that point.

Setting the Master
==================

The CLI should be installed on any machine where a user would like to access Determined. The ``-m``
or ``--master`` flag determines the network address of the Determined master that the CLI connects
to. If this flag is not specified, the value of the ``DET_MASTER`` environment variable is used; if
that environment variable is not set, the default address is ``localhost``. The master address can
be specified in three different formats:

-  ``example.org:port`` (if ``port`` is omitted, it defaults to ``8080``)
-  ``http://example.org:port`` (if ``port`` is omitted, it defaults to ``80``)
-  ``https://example.org:port`` (if ``port`` is omitted, it defaults to ``443``)

Examples:

.. code:: bash

   # Connect to localhost, port 8080.
   $ det experiment list

   # Connect to example.org, port 8888.
   $ det -m example.org:8888 e list

   # Connect to example.org, port 80.
   $ det -m http://example.org e list

   # Connect to example.org, port 443.
   $ det -m https://example.org e list

   # Connect to example.org, port 8080.
   $ det -m example.org e list

   # Set default Determined master address to example.org, port 8888.
   $ export DET_MASTER="example.org:8888"

**********
 Examples
**********

-  ``det e``, ``det experiment``, ``det experiment list``: Show information about experiments in the
   cluster.

-  ``det -m 1.2.3.4 e``, ``DET_MASTER=1.2.3.4 det e``: Show information about experiments in the
   cluster at the network address ``1.2.3.4``.

-  ``det t logs -f 289``: Show the existing logs for trial 289 and continue showing new logs as they
   come in.

-  ``det e label add 17 foobar``: Add the label "foobar" to experiment 17.

-  ``det e describe 493 --metrics --csv``: Display information about experiment 493, including full
   metrics information, in CSV format.

-  ``det e create -f --paused const.yaml .``: Create an experiment with the configuration file
   ``const.yaml`` and the code contained in the current directory. The experiment will be created in
   a paused state (that is, it will not be scheduled on the cluster until it is activated).

-  ``det e set max-slots 85 4``: Ensure that experiment 85 does not take up more than 4 slots in the
   cluster.

-  ``det u create --admin hoid``: Create a new user named "hoid" with admin privileges.

-  ``det version``: Show detailed information about the CLI and master. Note that this command does
   not take both an object and an action.

 Environment Variables
***********************

-  ``DET_MASTER``: The network address of the master of the Determined installation. The value can
   be overridden using the ``-m`` flag.
