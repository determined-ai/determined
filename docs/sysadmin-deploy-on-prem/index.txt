******************************
 Install a Determined Cluster
******************************

A :ref:`Determined cluster <install-cluster>` comprises a :ref:`master and one or more agents
<det-system-architecture>`. A Determined cluster can be installed on Amazon Web Services (AWS),
Google Cloud Platform (GCP), an on-premise cluster, or on a local development machine.

On-premise Deployments
======================

On-premise deployments are useful if you already have access to the machines that you would like to
install Determined on, whether that means a single laptop for local development or a fleet of
multi-GPU servers.

``det deploy`` is the most convenient on-premise option; once installed, it will allow you to start
a cluster by running a single command on each machine. If you would like more control over the
process, you can instead manually manage the Docker images that ``det deploy`` uses internally. If
you are using Ubuntu, you also have the option of installing most components of Determined using
Debian packages and running them as `systemd <https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/>`__
services.

To install Determined on-premise, first :ref:`install Docker <install-docker>`. Then install
Determined by your preferred method:
