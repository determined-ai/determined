 Install Determined Using Linux Packages
#########################################

Determined releases Debian and RPM packages for installing the Determined master and agent as
systemd services on machines running Linux.

We support installing the Determined master and agent using Debian packages on Ubuntu 16.04 or
18.04, or using RPM packages on Red Hat 7-based Linux distributions (e.g., Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
CentOS, Oracle Linux, and Scientific Linux).

*******************
 Preliminary Setup
*******************

PostgreSQL
==========

Determined uses a PostgreSQL database to store experiment and trial metadata. You may either use a
Docker container or your Linux distribution's package and service.

If you are using an existing PostgreSQL installation, we recommend confirming that
``max_connections`` is at least 96, which is sufficient for Determined.

Running PostgreSQL in Docker
----------------------------

#. Pull the official Docker image for PostgreSQL. We recommend using the version listed below.

   .. code::

      docker pull postgres:10

   This image is not provided by Determined AI; please see `its Docker Hub page
   <https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres>`_ for more information.

#. Start PostgreSQL as follows:

   .. code::

      docker run \
          -d \
          --restart unless-stopped \
          --name determined-db \
          -p 5432:5432 \
          -v determined_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
          -e POSTGRES_DB=determined \
          -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<Database password> \
          postgres:10

   If the master will connect to PostgreSQL via Docker networking, exposing port 5432 via the ``-p``
   argument isn't necessary; however, you may still want to expose it for administrative or
   debugging purposes. In order to expose the port only on the master machine's loopback network
   interface, pass ``-p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432`` instead of ``-p 5432:5432``.

Installing PostgreSQL via ``apt`` or ``yum``
--------------------------------------------

#. Install PostgreSQL 10.

   On Debian distributions:

   .. code::

      sudo apt install postgresql-10

   On Red Hat distributions, first configure the PostgreSQL yum repository as described `here
   <https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat>`_ in order to then install version 10:

   .. code::

      sudo yum install postgresql-server -y
      sudo postgresql-setup initdb
      sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
      sudo systemctl enable postgresql.service

#. Configure a system account that Determined will use to connect to PostgreSQL. For example, to use
   the default ``postgres`` user but update its password:

   .. code::

      sudo -u postgres psql postgres
      postgres=# \password postgres

#. Finally, create a database for Determined's use.

   .. code::

      postgres=# CREATE DATABASE determined;

Master and Agent
================

#. Go to `the webpage for the latest Determined release
   <https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/releases/latest>`_.

#. Download the appropriate Debian or RPM package file, which will have the name
   ``determined-master_VERSION_linux_amd64.[deb|rpm]`` (with ``VERSION`` replaced by an actual
   version, such as |version|). The agent package is similarly named
   ``determined-agent_VERSION_linux_amd64.[deb|rpm]``.

#. Install the master package on one machine in your cluster, and the agent package on each agent
   machine.

   On Debian distributions:

      .. code::

         sudo apt install <path to downloaded package>

   On Red Hat distributions:

      .. code::

         sudo rpm -i <path to downloaded package>

   Before running the Determined agent, you will have to :ref:`install Docker <install-docker>` on
   each agent machine and, if the machine has GPUs, ensure that the :ref:`Nvidia Container Toolkit
   <validate-nvidia-container-toolkit>` is working as expected.

**************************************
 Configuring and Starting the Cluster
**************************************

#. Ensure that an instance of PostgreSQL is running and accessible from the machine where the master
   will be run.

#. Edit the :ref:`YAML configuration files <topic-guides_yaml>` at ``/etc/determined/master.yaml``
   (for the master) and ``/etc/determined/agent.yaml`` (for each agent) as appropriate for your
   setup. Ensure that the user, password, and database name correspond to your PostgreSQL
   configuration.

   .. code::

      db:
        host: <PostgreSQL server IP or hostname, e.g., 127.0.0.1 if running on the master>
        port: <PostgreSQL port, e.g., 5432 by default>
        name: <Database name, e.g., determined>
        user: <PostgreSQL user, e.g., postgres>
        password: <Database password>

#. Start the master.

   .. code::

      sudo systemctl start determined-master

   The master can also be run directly with the command ``determined-master``, which may be helpful
   for experimenting with Determined (e.g., testing different configuration options quickly before
   writing them to the configuration file).

#. Optionally, configure the master to start on boot.

   .. code::

      sudo systemctl enable determined-master

#. Verify that the master started successfully by viewing the log.

   .. code::

      journalctl -u determined-master

   You should see logging indicating that the master can successfully connect to the database, and
   the last line should indicate ``http server started`` on the configured WebUI port (8080 by
   default). You can also validate that the WebUI is running by navigating to
   ``http://<master>:8080`` with your web browser (or ``https://<master>:8443`` if TLS is enabled).
   You should see ``No Agents`` on the right-hand side of the top navigation bar.

#. Start the agent on each agent machine.

   .. code::

      sudo systemctl start determined-agent

   Similarly, the agent can be run with the command ``determined-agent``.

#. Optionally, configure the agent to start on boot.

   .. code::

      sudo systemctl enable determined-agent

#. Verify that each agent started successfully by viewing the log.

   .. code::

      journalctl -u determined-agent

   You should see logging indicating that the agent started successfully, detected compute devices,
   and connected to the master. On the Determined WebUI, you should now see slots available, both on
   the right-hand side of the top navigation bar, and if you select the ``Cluster`` view in the
   left-hand navigation panel.

**********************
 Managing the Cluster
**********************

To configure a service to start running automatically when its machine boots up, run ``sudo
systemctl enable <service>``, where the service is ``determined-master`` or ``determined-agent``.
You can also use ``sudo systemctl enable --now <service>`` to enable and immediately start a service
in one command.

To view the logging output of a service, run ``journalctl -u <service>``.

To manually stop a service, run ``sudo systemctl stop <service>``.
