|h3| *Welcome to Determined!*

************************
 What is Determined AI?
************************

Determined is an open source deep learning training platform that makes building models fast and
easy.

********************
 Why Determined AI?
********************

With Determined you can:

-  Train models faster using state-of-the-art :ref:`distributed training <multi-gpu-training>`,
   without changing your model code.
-  Automatically find high-quality models using advanced :ref:`hyperparameter tuning
   <hyperparameter-tuning>` from the creators of Hyperband.
-  Get more from your GPUs with smart scheduling, reducing cloud GPU costs by seamlessly using
   preemptible instances.
-  Leverage experiment tracking out-of-the-box to track and reproduce your work, tracking code
   versions, metrics, checkpoints, and hyperparameters.

Determined integrates these features into an easy-to-use, high-performance deep learning
environment. Spend your time building models instead of managing infrastructure. At the same time,
Determined lets you continue using popular Deep Learning libraries, such as :doc:`TensorFlow Keras
</training-apis/api-keras>`, :doc:`TensorFlow Estimator </training-apis/api-estimator>`, and
:doc:`PyTorch </training-apis/api-pytorch>`. Simply integrate the Determined API with your existing
model code.
