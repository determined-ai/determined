 Overview
**********

Determined is an open-source deep learning training platform that makes building models fast and
easy. Determined enables you to:

-  **Train models faster** using state-of-the-art :ref:`distributed training <multi-gpu-training>`,
   without changing your model code
-  **Automatically find high-quality models** with advanced :ref:`hyperparameter tuning
   <hyperparameter-tuning>` from the creators of Hyperband
-  **Get more from your GPUs** with smart scheduling and cut cloud GPU costs by seamlessly using
   preemptible instances
-  **Track and reproduce your work** with experiment tracking that works out-of-the-box, covering
   code versions, metrics, checkpoints, and hyperparameters

Determined integrates these features into an easy-to-use, high-performance deep learning environment
--- which means you can spend your time building models instead of managing infrastructure.

To use Determined, you can continue using popular DL frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch; you
just need to update your model code to integrate with the Determined API.

More information about Determined can be found on the `website <https://determined.ai/>`__.

*********************
 Get Started Locally
*********************

Follow `these instructions
<https://docs.determined.ai/latest/how-to/installation/requirements.html#install-docker>`_ to
install and set up Docker.

.. code:: bash

   # Start a Determined cluster locally.
   python3.7 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/test
   . ~/.virtualenvs/test/bin/activate
   pip install determined
   # To start a cluster with GPUs, remove `no-gpu` flag.
   det deploy local cluster-up --no-gpu
   # Access web UI at localhost:8080. By default, "determined" user accepts a blank password.

   # Navigate to a Determined example.
   git clone https://github.com/determined-ai/determined
   cd determined/examples/computer_vision/cifar10_pytorch

   # Submit job to train a single model on a single node.
   det experiment create const.yaml .

Installation
============

To install Determined, please follow the :ref:`installation instructions <install-cluster>`.
Determined can be installed on the public cloud, an on-premise cluster, or a local development
machine.

Each user should also :ref:`install the Determined command-line tools <install-cli>` on systems they
will use to access Determined.

Next Steps
==========

We recommend starting with the :ref:`quick-start` if you're new to Determined.

Next, learn more about Determined's Python APIs by following a tutorial. Follow the tutorial for
your preferred framework:

-  :ref:`pytorch-mnist-tutorial`
-  :ref:`tf-mnist-tutorial`
