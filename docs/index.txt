 Overview
**********

Determined is an open-source deep learning training platform that makes
building models fast and easy. Determined enables you to:

-  **Train models faster** using state-of-the-art :ref:`distributed
   training <multi-gpu-training>`, without changing your model code

-  **Automatically find high-quality models** with advanced
   :ref:`hyperparameter tuning <hyperparameter-tuning>` from the
   creators of Hyperband

-  **Get more from your GPUs** with smart scheduling and cut cloud GPU
   costs by seamlessly using preemptible instances

-  **Track and reproduce your work** with experiment tracking that works
   out-of-the-box, covering code versions, metrics, checkpoints, and
   hyperparameters

Determined integrates these features into an easy-to-use,
high-performance deep learning environment --- which means you can spend
your time building models instead of managing infrastructure.

To use Determined, you can continue using popular DL frameworks such as
TensorFlow and PyTorch; you just need to update your model code to
integrate with the Determined API.

More information about Determined can be found on the `website
<https://determined.ai/>`__.

*********************
 Get Started Locally
*********************

Follow `these instructions
<https://docs.determined.ai/latest/how-to/installation/requirements.html#install-docker>`_
to install and set up Docker.

.. code:: bash

   # Start a Determined cluster locally.
   python3.7 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/test
   . ~/.virtualenvs/test/bin/activate
   pip install determined
   # To start a cluster with GPUs, remove `no-gpu` flag.
   det deploy local cluster-up --no-gpu
   # Access web UI at localhost:8080. By default, "determined" user accepts a blank password.

   # Navigate to a Determined example.
   git clone https://github.com/determined-ai/determined
   cd determined/examples/computer_vision/cifar10_pytorch

   # Submit job to train a single model on a single node.
   det experiment create const.yaml .

Installation
============

To install Determined, please follow the :ref:`installation instructions
<install-cluster>`. Determined can be installed on the public cloud, an
on-premise cluster, or a local development machine.

Each user should also :ref:`install the Determined command-line tools
<install-cli>` on systems they will use to access Determined.

Next Steps
==========

We recommend starting with the :ref:`quick-start` if you're new to
Determined.

Next, learn more about Determined's Python APIs by following a tutorial.
Follow the tutorial for your preferred framework:

-  :ref:`pytorch-mnist-tutorial`
-  :ref:`tf-mnist-tutorial`

 Documentation Structure
*************************

The Determined documentation is divided up into five main categories:

-  **Tutorials** are simple step-by-step guides about getting started
   with different topics of Determined. Tutorials are a good place to
   get started with using the product.

-  **Topic Guides** discuss concepts and topics at a high level. They
   provide useful information and explanation.

-  **Reference** guides contain technical reference for our APIs. They
   describe how to use it; however, these guides assume you have a
   working understanding of key concepts of Determined.

-  **How-to** guides take you through the steps needed to address key
   use-cases. You can think of them as advanced tutorials that assume
   some knowledge of key concepts of Determined.

-  **System administration** guides take you through what's needed to
   set up and configure the Determined system.
