**********
 Overview
**********

Determined is an open-source Deep Learning Training Platform that
incorporates cutting-edge research and years of practical experience to
help deep learning teams **train models more quickly, easily share GPU
resources, and effectively collaborate**. Determined allows deep
learning engineers to focus on building and training models at scale,
without needing to worry about DevOps or writing custom code for common
tasks like fault tolerance or experiment tracking. More information
about Determined can be found on the `website
<https://determined.ai/>`_.

**************************************
 What does Determined handle for you?
**************************************

You can think of Determined as a platform that bridges the gap between
tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch---which work great for a single
researcher with a single GPU---and the challenges that arise when doing
deep learning at scale, as teams, clusters, and data sets all increase
in size.

Determined's key capabilities include:

-  high-performance :ref:`distributed training <multi-gpu-training>`
   without any additional changes to your model code

-  intelligent :ref:`hyperparameter tuning <hyperparameter-tuning>`
   based on cutting-edge research

-  flexible GPU scheduling, including dynamically resizing training jobs
   on-the-fly, automatic management of cloud resources on AWS and GCP,
   and optional :ref:`support for Kubernetes <determined-on-kubernetes>`

-  built-in experiment tracking, metrics visualization, and :ref:`model
   registry <organizing-models>`

-  automatic fault tolerance for deep learning training jobs

-  integrated support for :ref:`TensorBoard <how-to-tensorboard>` and
   GPU-powered :ref:`Jupyter notebooks <how-to-notebooks>`

To use Determined, you can continue using popular deep learning
frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch; you just need to modify your
model code to implement the Determined API.

*************
 Quick Start
*************

Installation
============

To install Determined, please follow the :ref:`installation instructions
<install-cluster>`. Determined can be installed on the public cloud, an
on-premise cluster, or a local development machine.

Each user should also :ref:`install the Determined command-line tools
<install-cli>` on systems they will use to access Determined.

Next Steps
==========

We recommend you follow our :ref:`quick-start` if you're new to
Determined.

Next, learn more about our Experiment APIs by following our tutorials.
If you're using TensorFlow Keras or Estimator and want to get started
quickly with a minimal modification of source code, follow our Native
API tutorial:

-  :ref:`tutorials_native-api`

If you're using PyTorch or want a finer-grained level of control over
the training loop, follow our Trial API tutorials in your preferred
framework:

-  :ref:`pytorch-mnist-tutorial`
-  :ref:`tf-mnist-tutorial`

*************************
 Documentation Structure
*************************

The Determined documentation is divided up into five main categories:

-  **Tutorials** are simple step-by-step guides about getting started
   with different topics of Determined. Tutorials are a good place to
   get started with using the product.

-  **Topic Guides** discuss concepts and topics at a high level. They
   provide useful information and explanation.

-  **Reference** guides contain technical reference for our APIs. They
   describe how to use it; however, these guides assume you have a
   working understanding of key concepts of Determined.

-  **How-to** guides take you through the steps needed to address key
   use-cases. You can think of them as advanced tutorials that assume
   some knowledge of key concepts of Determined.

-  **System administration** guides take you through what's needed to
   set up and configure the Determined system.
