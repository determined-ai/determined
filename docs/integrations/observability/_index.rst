 Kubernetes Observability
##########################

This provides documentation and recommendations on how to set up monitoring for a Determined
installation on Kubernetes.

*********
 Prereqs
*********

-  Determied must be running in a Kubernetes cluster.

-  Determined must have the Helm value ``observability.enable_prometheus`` set to true. This is
   defaulted to true.

-  Determined CLI must be installed and configured to talk to the Determined instance.

-  Kubectl must be installed and configured for the Kubernetes cluster.

-  The Kubernetes namespace ``det-monitoring`` should be created and non empty.

   .. code:: bash

      kubectl create ns det-monitoring

-  Change directory to the determined repo ``tools/observability``. This can be done with

   .. code:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/determined-ai/determined.git && \
        cd determined/tools/observability

***************
 Token refresh
***************

Determined Prometheus export endpoint is secured by authentication. As a result a Determined
authentication token is needed for the Prometheus scraper. Determined tokens have an expiration of 1
week. So we are going to configure a token refresh cronjob to run on the Kubernetes cluster.

#. Create a Determined account that will be used in the job.

.. code:: bash

   det -u admin user create tokenrefresher

#. Change the password of the Determined account.

.. code:: bash

   det -u admin user change-password tokenrefresher

#. Store the username and password inside a credential.

.. code:: bash

   kubectl -n det-monitoring create secret generic token-refresh-username-pass \
     --from-literal="creds=tokenrefresher:testPassword1"

#. Create the job and cronjob.

.. attention::

   ``tokenRefresher.yaml`` won't work in every possible Kuberenetes set up. If you have a unique use
   case it might need to be modified to work. Hardcoding the Determined master ip can reduce a lot
   of assumptions the script makes.

.. code:: bash

   kubectl -n det-monitoring apply -f tokenRefresher.yaml

#. Wait for a few minutes then check the ``det-prom-token`` secret was created.

.. code:: bash

   kubectl -n det-monitoring describe secret det-prom-token

   Name:         det-prom-token
   Namespace:    default
   Labels:       <none>
   Annotations:  <none>

   Type:  Opaque

   Data
   ====
   det-token:  217 bytes``

***********************
 Install DCGM Exporter
***********************

The DCGM exporter is used to allow Prometheus to get GPU metrics. This can be installed in a variety
of different ways. If you are deploying in a cloud based environment you should follow their
documentation.

A setup method for GKE is included here for convenience. For other clouds or on prem deployments you
may have to install the DCGM exportor slightly differently and change the
``additionalScrapeConfigs`` accordingly in the ``grafana-prom-values.yaml`` in later steps.

If you are deploying on prem it is recommended to reference the `Nvidia docs on installing the DCGM
exporter
<https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-telemetry/latest/kube-prometheus.html#setting-up-dcgm>`__.

#. Create a namespace for the exporter

.. code:: bash

   kubectl create ns gmp-public

#. Copy and apply the file from the `GKE documentation
   <https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/exporters/nvidia-dcgm#install-exporter>`__
   in the ``gmp-public`` namespace

.. code:: bash

   kubectl apply -n gmp-public -f file.yaml

#. Create a service for the DCGM exporter.

.. code:: bash

   kubectl apply -n gmp-public -f gkeDCGMExporterService.yaml

This differs from the GKE docs linked above because we are going to deploy a Prometheus instalation
instead of using the managed service Google Cloud Offers. It is possible to use the managed offering
from Google Cloud but some features like GPU statistics by user will not work.

#. Verify DCGM works by port forwarding the service.

.. code:: bash

   kubectl -n gmp-public port-foward service/nvidia-dcgm-exporter 9400

#. In a new console tab check the service works.

.. code:: bash

   curl 127.0.0.1:9400/metrics

*******************************
 Install Kube Prometheus Stack
*******************************

#. Add the Helm repo.

.. code:: bash

   helm repo add prometheus-community \
     https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts && \
     helm update

#. Helm install the Kube Prometheus Stack. Change the password in the below command.

.. code:: bash

   helm install monitor prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
     --set grafana.adminPassword=testPassword \
     --values grafanaPrometheus.yaml

#. Add API monitoring dashboard

.. code:: bash

   kubectl create configmap detapidash --from-file api-dash.json && \
     kubectl label configmap detapidash grafana_dashboard=1

#. TODO add other dashboards for monitoring
#. Check Prometheus is running properly. Port forward with this command

.. code:: bash

   kubectl port-forward service/monitor-kube-prometheus-st-prometheus 9090:9090

Verify that Prometheus is scraping DCGM and the Determined API server metrics. Go to 127.0.0.1:9090
and check the query ``up{twojobsTODO query}`` returns 1 for both results.

#. Access Grafana to view dashboards.

.. code:: bash

   kubectl port-forward svc/monitor-grafana 9000:80

Go to ``127.0.0.1:9090 <127.0.0.1:9000>``__ and use the username ``admin`` and password the password
we set in the second step. The ``Determined API Server Monitoring`` dashboard should be included.
