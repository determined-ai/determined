Determined is designed to easily integrate with other popular ML ecosystem tools for tasks that are
related to model training, such as ETL, ML pipelines, and model serving. It is recommended to use
the Python SDK to interact with Determined.

Our `Works with Determined <https://github.com/determined-ai/works-with-determined>`__ repository
includes examples of how to use Determined with a variety of ML ecosystem tools, including
Pachyderm, DVC, Delta Lake, Seldon, Spark, Argo, Airflow, and Kubeflow.
