   :description: Discover how Determined integrates with other popular machine learning ecosystem tools.

Determined seamlessly integrates with popular ML ecosystem tools to enhance your model training
workflow. From data transformation to monitoring and alerting, our integrations help streamline your
ML pipeline.

******************
 Key Integrations
******************

-  **Data Transformation**: Integrate with tools like :ref:`pachyderm-integration` to streamline
   your data preprocessing.

-  **Development Environments**: Use Determined shells in popular IDEs, similar to remote SSH hosts.
   Learn more at :ref:`ides-index`.

-  **Workload Alerting**: Set up :ref:`workload-alerting` through webhooks to stay informed about
   your experiments in real-time. For a comprehensive overview of notification options, see
   :ref:`notifications`.

-  **Monitoring**: Enable Grafana dashboards to monitor hardware and system metrics on cloud
   clusters. See :ref:`prometheus-grafana` for details.

*****************
 Getting Started
*****************

To make the most of these integrations, we recommend using the :ref:`python-sdk` to interact with
Determined.
