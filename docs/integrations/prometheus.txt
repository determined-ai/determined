This document describes the setup and configuration to enable a Grafana dashboard to monitor
Determined hardware and system metrics on a cloud cluster, such as AWS or Kubernetes. Determined
provides a Prometheus endpoint that contains mappings between internal task, GPU, and container
definitions, which are used by Prometheus to collect relevant metrics on a cluster running
Determined. The endpoint is not enabled by default but can be enabled in the master configuration
file.

`Grafana <https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/>`__

`Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/>`__

`dcgm-exporter <https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter>`__

*************
 Constraints
*************

The Determined Prometheus endpoint is configured to work with `cAdvisor
<https://github.com/google/cadvisor>`__ for CPU metrics and `dcgm-exporter
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter>`__ (DCGM) for GPU metrics. The default ports for cAdvisor,
8080, and dcgm-exporter, 9400, are hardcoded into the Prometheus endpoint. If an agent is running on
the same machine as the master, the master must be running on a port other than 8080 for cAdvisor
metrics to be scraped. Although other monitoring tools can be used with the setup, this guide
describes only cAdvisor and DCGM tool configuration. Prometheus queries on metrics collected by
other tools can differ, depending on the format and organization of the returned metrics.

***************
 Prerequisites
***************

-  A Grafana installation for dashboard monitoring.
-  An on-cluster Prometheus instance for time-series data collection.

.. _prometheus:

**********************
 Configure Determined
**********************

Install and run Determined on a cluster. When launching the master instance, enable the Prometheus
endpoints by adding a flag to the ``master.yaml`` configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

   observability:
       enable_prometheus: true

This enables the following two Prometheus API endpoints on the instance.

-  ``{$DET_MASTER_ADDR}/prom/det-state-metrics``:

   The ``det-state-metrics`` endpoint includes various machine-level label mappings to internal
   Determined entities, such as GPU UUIDs and container IDs to task, allocation, and experiment
   labels, which are used by PromQL to join vectors.

-  ``{$DET_MASTER_ADDR}/prom/det-http-sd-config``:

   The ``det-http-sd-config`` endpoint contains address and resource pool information for currently
   active agents. These are used by Prometheus as targets for scraping. This endpoint is configured
   to support running default cAdvisor, port 8080, and DCGM, port 9400, monitoring. Other tools
   exposing Prometheus metrics can be used instead of cAdvisor and DCGM if they are running on these
   ports.

**************************************
 Configure cAdvisor and dcgm-exporter
**************************************

The cAdvisor and dcgm-exporter monitoring tools must be running on the cluster agents to be
monitored. These can be installed manually or run as individual Docker containers.

To configure dynamic agents to start up with cAdvisor and dcgm-exporter, add the following startup
script to the ``master.yaml`` file:

.. code:: yaml

   - pool_name: compute-pool
       provider:
         startup_script: |
           # Run dcgm-exporter on 9400
           docker run -d --gpus all --rm -p 9400:9400 nvcr.io/nvidia/k8s/dcgm-exporter:2.3.2-2.6.3-ubuntu20.04

           # Run cAdvisor on 8080
           VERSION=v0.36.0
           docker run \
             --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
             --volume=/var/run:/var/run:ro \
             --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
             --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
             --volume=/dev/disk/:/dev/disk:ro \
             --publish=8080:8080 \
             --detach=true \
             --name=cadvisor \
             --privileged \
             --device=/dev/kmsg \
             gcr.io/cadvisor/cadvisor:$VERSION

This example startup script includes the default setup docker commands provided by `dcgm-exporter
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter>`__ and `cAdvisor <https://github.com/google/cadvisor>`__.

**********************
 Configure Prometheus
**********************

#. `Install Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/>`__ on any node
   in the monitored cluster.

#. Launch Prometheus with the provided `prometheus.yml
   <https://github.com/determined-ai/works-with-determined#observability-tools>`__ configuration
   file.

#. The Prometheus configuration file needs a manual change to replace the placeholder master
   address.

   The ``metric_relabel_configs`` parameter edits certain label names in jobs for joining in PromQL.
   - The ``scrape_interval`` parameter values can be modified to optimize for resolution/size/time.

*******************
 Configure Grafana
*******************

A Grafana instance can be installed on any machine that adds the above Prometheus address as a data
source. After the Grafana server is running and the Web UI is accessible, follow these steps:

#. Add a Prometheus data source in **Grafana** -> **Configuration** -> **Data Sources** -> **Add
   data source**.

   Configure the Prometheus data source set up in the previous section by setting the URL to your
   running Prometheus server address. By default, this is the machine address on port 9090.

#. After the Prometheus data source connects, import the `Determined Hardware Metrics dashboard JSON
   <https://github.com/determined-ai/works-with-determined/blob/master/observability/grafana/determined-hardware-grafana.json>`__
   file in **Grafana** -> **Create** -> **Import** -> **Import using panel JSON**.

*********
 Example
*********

Following the above configuration steps and after submitting experiments on the cluster, you should
see populated panels in the imported Grafana dashboard: **Grafana** -> **Dashboards**.

   :alt: Grafana Dashboard

Each panel in the dashboard is powered by one or more Prometheus queries and tracks a specific
metric on the cluster as a percentage of total capacity. Results can be further filtered using
``tags`` and ``resource pool`` and time range in Grafana.
