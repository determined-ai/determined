Monitoring experiment status is a vital part of working with Determined. In order to integrate
Determined into your existing workflows, you can make use of webhooks to update other systems,
receive emails, slack messages, and more when an experiment is updated.

Webhooks such as tasklog webhooks are useful for real-time monitoring, debugging, custom
notifications, and integration with other systems. For example, using ``Tasklog``, you could get
updates as they happen rather than wait for the task to reach a final state such as ``Completed`` or
``Error``.

.. _webhook_security:

*****************************
 Security and Signed Payload
*****************************

Each webhook request will include a signed payload that users can use to verify that webhook calls
from Determined are genuine. This will require that users define a ``webhook_signing_key`` for
signing. If a webhook signing key is not provided then one will be generated for the user.

Setting the Key
===============

The signing key can be set in the following ways:

#. In the master yaml configuration file by adding:

.. code::

   webhooks:
      signing_key: <signing_key>

2. By setting a ``DET_WEBHOOKS_SIGNING_KEY`` environment variable.
#. By specifying a ``---security-webhooks-signing-key`` flag.

Retrieving the Key
==================

The key can be found in the cluster configuration. For example it will be returned in
``api/v1/master/config``.

Event Payload
=============

Determined supports two types of webhooks: ``Slack`` and ``Default``. A payload for a ``Default``
webhook will contain information about the event itself, the trigger for the event, and the entity
that triggered the event. The shape of ``event_data`` is determined by ``event_type``. Below is an
example payload for ``EXPERIMENT_STATE_CHANGE``; other types may be structured differently.

.. code::

   {
     "event_id": "4cd26e62-60c6-4a8b-8d03-7629091a4ef5",   // unique event UUID
     "event_type": "EXPERIMENT_STATE_CHANGE", // the trigger type for the event
     "timestamp": 1665689991, // the timestamp of the event occurrence
     "condition": {
       "state": "COMPLETED" // the condition that triggered the event; for now the condition will always be of this format and contain either "COMPLETED" or "ERRORED"
     },
     "event_data": {
       "experiment": {
         "id": 41,
         "state": "COMPLETED",
         "name": "cifar10_pytorch_const",
         "slots_per_trial": 2,
         "duration": 41, // experiment duration measured in seconds
         "resource_pool": "default",
         "workspace": "test workspace", // experiment workspace name
         "project": "test project" // experiment project name
      }
     }
   }

Signed Payload
==============

For every webhook request Determined will generate two headers, ``X-Determined-AI-Signature`` and
``X-Determined-AI-Signature-Timestamp``, which can be used to verify each request to a webhook
endpoint.

-  The ``X-Determined-AI-Signature-Timestamp`` will represent the time at which the request was
   generated and sent. You can choose to inspect this timestamp and decide whether to discard any
   requests with a timestamp that is too distant from the current time.

-  The ``X-Determined-AI-Signature`` will be a representation of a "signed" request payload. The
   signed request payload will be generated in the following way:

   -  Combine the timestamp in ``X-Determined-AI-Signature-Timestamp``, the comma character "," and
      the request body, which will be the entire event payload.
   -  Create an HMAC using SHA256 hashing, with the ``webhook_signing_key`` and the event payload
      from previous step.

-  You can then check to make sure the ``X-Determined-AI-Signature`` header value and the generated
   signed payload match.

Below is an example of handling a signed payload in Python.

.. code:: python

   import hashlib, hmac, json

   # User-defined function to authenticate webhook requests
   def authenticate_webhook_request(request_body, request_headers, webhook_signing_key):
       timestamp = request_headers["X-Determined-AI-Signature-Timestamp"]
       signed_payload = request_headers["X-Determined-AI-Signature"]
       request_body = json.dumps(separators=(",", ":"), obj=json.loads(request_body))
       calculated_signed_payload = hmac.new(
           webhook_signing_key.encode(),
           f"{timestamp},{request_body}".encode(),
           digestmod=hashlib.sha256,
       ).hexdigest()
       return calculated_signed_payload == signed_payload

.. note::

   The request body in the function shown above will be the JSON payload from the request. Ensure
   that the JSON payload does not contain spaces between keys and their values when creating the
   signed payload. For example "{"key_one": "value_one"}" will fail authentication, while
   "{"key_one":"value_one"}" will yield the correct signed payload value.

.. _supported-webhook-triggers:

Supported Triggers
==================

``Completed`` or ``Error`` will be triggered when an experiment in scope is completed or errored.

``Tasklog`` will be triggered when a task matching regex is detected.

``Custom`` will only be triggered from experiment code.

.. code::

   # Here is an example code to trigger a custom trigger.

   # config.yaml
   integrations:
      webhooks:
         webhook_name:
            - <webhook_name>

   # code.py
   with det.core.init() as core_context:
      core_context.alert(title="some title", description="some description", level="info")

*******************
 Creating Webhooks
*******************

To create a webhook, follow these steps:

-  Navigate to ``/det/webhooks`` or select **Webhooks** in the left-side navigation pane.
-  Choose **New Webhook**.

   :width: 100%
   :alt: Webhooks interface showing New Webhook button.

.. note::

   If you do not have sufficient permissions to view and create webhooks, consult with a systems
   administrator.

-  Workspace: Select a workspace where you have permission to create webhooks.
-  Name: Supply a unique identifier for referencing the webhook in the experiment configuration.
-  URL: Enter the webhook URL.
-  Type: Choose either ``Default`` or ``Slack``. The ``Slack`` type automatically formats message
   content for better readability on Slack.
-  Trigger: Select the event you want to monitor. See the list of supported triggers in the
   :ref:`supported-webhook-triggers` section.
-  Triggered by: Choose whether to monitor all experiments within the workspace. For the ``Custom``
   option, the trigger applies only to specific experiments.

.. code::

   # Example of an experiment configuration with webhooks

   integrations:
      webhooks:
         webhook_name:
            - <webhook_name>

-  Regex: If the webhook is configured to trigger on Tasklog, define a regex using `Golang Regex
   Syntax <https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax>`_.
