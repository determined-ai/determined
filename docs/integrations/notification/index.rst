 Monitoring Experiment Through Webhooks
########################################

Monitoring experiment status is a vital part of working with Determined. In order to integrate
Determined into your existing workflows, you can make use of webhooks to update other systems,
receive emails, slack messages, and more when an experiment is updated.

.. _webhook_security:

*****************************
 Security and Signed Payload
*****************************

Each webhook request will include a signed payload that users can use to verify that webhook calls
from Determined are genuine. This will require that users define a ``webhook_signing_key`` for
signing. If a webhook signing key is not provided then one will be generated for the user.

Setting the Key
===============

The signing key can be set in the following ways:

#. In the master yaml configuration file by adding:

.. code::

   webhooks:
      signing_key: <signing_key>

2. By setting a ``DET_WEBHOOKS_SIGNING_KEY`` environment variable.
#. By specifying a ``---security-webhooks-signing-key`` flag.

Retrieving the Key
==================

The key can be found in the cluster configuration. For example it will be returned in
``api/v1/master/config``.

Event Payload
=============

Currently we support two types of webhooks: ``Slack`` and ``Default``. A payload for a ``Default``
webhook will contain information about the event itself, the trigger for the event, and the entity
that triggered the event. The shape of ``event_data`` is determined by ``event_type``. Below is an
example payload for ``EXPERIMENT_STATE_CHANGE``; other types may be structured differently.

.. code::

   {
     "event_id": "4cd26e62-60c6-4a8b-8d03-7629091a4ef5",   // unique event UUID
     "event_type": "EXPERIMENT_STATE_CHANGE", // the trigger type for the event
     "timestamp": 1665689991, // the timestamp of the event occurrence
     "condition": {
       "state": "COMPLETED" // the condition that triggered the event; for now the condition will always be of this format and contain either "COMPLETED" or "ERRORED"
     },
     "event_data": {
       "experiment": {
         "id": 41,
         "state": "COMPLETED",
         "name": "cifar10_pytorch_const",
         "slots_per_trial": 2,
         "duration": 41, // experiment duration measured in seconds
         "resource_pool": "default",
         "workspace": "test workspace", // experiment workspace name
         "project": "test project" // experiment project name
      }
     }
   }

Signed Payload
==============

For every webhook request Determined will generate two headers, ``X-Determined-AI-Signature`` and
``X-Determined-AI-Signature-Timestamp``, which can be used to verify each request to a webhook
endpoint.

-  The ``X-Determined-AI-Signature-Timestamp`` will represent the time at which the request was
   generated and sent. You can choose to inspect this timestamp and decide whether to discard any
   requests with a timestamp that is too distant from the current time.

-  The ``X-Determined-AI-Signature`` will be a representation of a "signed" request payload. The
   signed request payload will be generated in the following way:

   -  Combine the timestamp in ``X-Determined-AI-Signature-Timestamp``, the comma character "," and
      the request body, which will be the entire event payload.
   -  Create an HMAC using SHA256 hashing, with the ``webhook_signing_key`` and the event payload
      from previous step.

-  You can then check to make sure the ``X-Determined-AI-Signature`` header value and the generated
   signed payload match.

Below is an example of handling a signed payload in Python.

.. code:: python

   import hashlib, hmac, json

   # User-defined function to authenticate webhook requests
   def authenticate_webhook_request(request_body, request_headers, webhook_signing_key):
       timestamp = request_headers["X-Determined-AI-Signature-Timestamp"]
       signed_payload = request_headers["X-Determined-AI-Signature"]
       request_body = json.dumps(separators=(",", ":"), obj=json.loads(request_body))
       calculated_signed_payload = hmac.new(
           webhook_signing_key.encode(),
           f"{timestamp},{request_body}".encode(),
           digestmod=hashlib.sha256,
       ).hexdigest()
       return calculated_signed_payload == signed_payload

.. note::

   The request body in the function shown above will be the JSON payload from the request. Ensure
   that the JSON payload does not contain spaces between keys and their values when creating the
   signed payload. For example "{"key_one": "value_one"}" will fail authentication, while
   "{"key_one":"value_one"}" will yield the correct signed payload value.

*******************
 Creating Webhooks
*******************

To create a webhook, navigate to ``/det/webhooks`` or click on the "Webhooks" item in navigation
side menu, and click on the top right corner button "New Webhook".

   :alt: Webhooks interface showing New Webhook button.

.. note::

   You must have the relevant permission to be able to view this page. Consult a system admin if you
   are unsure about your permissions.

At the modal input:

-  URL: webhook URL.
-  Type: ``Default`` or ``Slack``. The ``Slack`` type can automatically format message content for
   better readability on Slack.
-  Trigger: the experiment state change you want to monitor, either ``Completed`` or ``Error``.

Once created, your webhook will begin executing for the chosen events.

******************
 Testing Webhooks
******************

To test a webhook, click on the triple dots on the right of webhook record to expand available
actions.

Clicking on "Test Webhook" will trigger a test event to be sent to the defined webhook URL with a
mock payload as stated below:

.. code::

   {
      "event_id": "b8667b8a-e14d-40e5-83ee-a64e31bdc5f4",
      "event_type": "EXPERIMENT_STATE_CHANGE",
      "timestamp": 1665695871,
      "condition": {
         "state": "COMPLETED"
      },
      "event_data": {
         "data": "test"
      }
   }

*******************
 Deleting Webhooks
*******************

To delete a webhook, click on the triple dots on the right of webhook record to expand available
actions.

.. note::

   We do not support editing webhooks. You can delete and recreate webhooks if needed.
