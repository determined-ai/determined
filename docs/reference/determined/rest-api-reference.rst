Reference: `Determined API <../../rest-api/index.html>`__.

You will see a list of all the available endpoints grouped by their workflows. As you
click on each endpoint, a list of expected inputs and outputs is displayed along with an
interactive tool that lets you try the endpoint. For the interactive portion to work,
you need to have the appropriate cookie set and have a running cluster.

The :doc:`/intro/det-if/rest-api` user guide gives an example of how to authenticate and use the API. You can also log in using the WebUI.

The endpoint documentation and sandbox are provided using the `Swagger UI <https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/>`__, which gives you an up-to-date, readable, and interactive view of the APIs your Determined cluster provides:

   "Swagger UI allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and
   interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s
   automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the
   visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client-side consumption."

If you have access to a running Determined cluster you can checkout the live-interact version by
clicking the API icon from the Determined WebUI or by navigating to `/docs/rest-api/` on your
Determined cluster.
