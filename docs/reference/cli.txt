Command-line Interface
======================

The Determined command-line interface (CLI) is installed under the name
``det``. Most uses of it require arguments specifying a type of object
to act on and the action to perform, followed by any additional
arguments or options. For example,

.. code::

   det experiment config 17

displays the configuration for experiment 17. Some commands have an
additional level of nesting:

.. code::

   det experiment label add 17 foobar

adds the label "foobar" to experiment 17.

The names of some objects, actions, and options may be abbreviated;
alternative names are shown in the full reference in parentheses. For
example, these two commands are equivalent:

.. code::

   det -u admin experiment list
   det --user admin experiment list

as are these two:

.. code::

   det e config 17
   det experiment config 17

Additionally, when ``list`` is a valid action, it is the default when no
action is specified, so the following pairs of commands are also equivalent:

.. code::

   det e
   det experiment list

.. code::

   det s
   det slot list

Providing ``-h`` or ``--help`` as an argument anywhere will cause the
CLI to exit after printing help text for the object or action specified
up to that point.

Environment Variables
---------------------

* ``DET_MASTER``: The network address of the master of the Determined
  installation. The value can be overridden using the ``-m`` flag.

Examples
--------

- ``det e``, ``det experiment``, ``det experiment list``: Show
  information about experiments in the cluster.

- ``det -m 1.2.3.4 e``, ``DET_MASTER=1.2.3.4 det e``: Show
  information about experiments in the cluster at the network address
  ``1.2.3.4``.

- ``det t logs -f 289``: Show the existing logs for trial 289 and
  continue showing new logs as they come in.

- ``det e label add 17 foobar``: Add the label "foobar" to
  experiment 17.

- ``det e describe 493 --metrics --csv``: Display information about
  experiment 493, including full metrics information, in CSV format.

- ``det e create -f --paused const.yaml .``: Create an experiment with
  the configuration file ``const.yaml`` and the code contained in the
  current directory. The experiment will be created in a paused state
  (that is, it will not be scheduled on the cluster until it is
  activated).

- ``det e set max-slots 85 4``: Ensure that experiment 85 does not take
  up more than 4 slots in the cluster.

- ``det u create --admin hoid``: Create a new user named "hoid" with
  admin privileges.

- ``det version``: Show detailed information about the CLI and master.
  Note that this command does not take both an object and an action.
