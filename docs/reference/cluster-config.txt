 Cluster Configuration
#######################

The behavior of the master and agent can be controlled by setting
configuration variables; this can be done using a configuration file,
environment variables, or command-line options. Although values from
different sources will be merged, we generally recommend sticking to a
single source for each service to keep things simple.

The master and the agent both accept an optional ``--config-file``
command-line option, which specifies the path of the configuration file
to use. Note that when running the master or agent inside a container,
you will need to make the configuration file accessible inside the
container (e.g., via a bind mount). For example, this command starts the
agent using a configuration file:

.. code::

   docker run \
     -v `pwd`/agent-config.yaml:/etc/determined/agent-config.yaml \
     determinedai/determined-agent
     --config-file /etc/determined/agent-config.yaml

The ``agent-config.yaml`` file might contain

.. code:: yaml

   master_host: 127.0.0.1
   master_port: 8080

to configure the address of the Determined master that the agent will
attempt to connect to.

Each option in the master or agent configuration file can also be
specified as an environment variable or a command-line option. To
configure the behavior of the master or agent using environment
variables, specify an environment variable starting with ``DET_``
followed by the name of the configuration variable. Underscores (``_``)
should be used to indicate nested options: for example, the
``scheduler.fit`` master configuration option can be specified via an
environment variable named ``DET_SCHEDULER_FIT``.

The equivalent of the agent configuration file shown above can be
specified by setting two environment variables, ``DET_MASTER_HOST`` and
``DET_MASTER_PORT``. When starting the agent as a container, environment
variables can be specified as part of ``docker run``:

.. code::

   docker run \
     -e DET_MASTER_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
     -e DET_MASTER_PORT=8080 \
     determinedai/determined-agent

The equivalent behavior can be achieved using command-line options:

.. code::

   determined-agent run --master-host=127.0.0.1 --master-port=8080

The same behavior applies to master configuration settings as well. For
example, configuring the host where the Postgres database is running can
be done via a configuration file containing:

.. code:: yaml

   db:
     host: the-db-host

Equivalent behavior can be achieved by setting the
``DET_DB_HOST=the-db-host`` environment variable or ``--db-host
the-db-host`` command-line option.

In the rest of this document, we will refer to options using their names
in the configuration file. Periods (``.``) will be used to indicate
nested options; for example, the option above would be indicated by
``db.host``.

****************
 Common Options
****************

Master Port
===========

By default, the master listens on TCP port 8080. This can be configured
via the ``port`` option.

.. _security:

Security
========

The master can secure all incoming connections using `TLS
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`__. That
ability requires a TLS private key and certificate to be provided; set
the options ``security.tls.cert`` and ``security.tls.key`` to paths to a
PEM-encoded TLS certificate and private key, respectively, to do so. If
TLS is enabled, the default port becomes 8443 rather than 8080.

.. note::

   To use Determined with TLS, you may need a private Certificate
   Authority and Split-Horizon DNS, depending on where your
   infrastructure resides.

.. _agent-network-proxy:

Configuring Trial Runner Networking
===================================

The master is capable of selecting the network interface that trial
runners will use to communicate when performing distributed
(multi-machine) training. The network interface can be configured by
editing ``task_container_defaults.dtrain_network_interface``. If left
unspecified, which is the default setting, Determined will auto-discover
a common network interface shared by the trial runners.

.. note::

   For :ref:`multi-gpu-training`, Determined automatically detects a
   common network interface shared by the agent machines. If your
   cluster has multiple common network interfaces, please specify the
   fastest one.

Additionally, the ports used by the GLOO and NCCL libraries, which are
used during distributed (multi-machine) training can be configured to
fall within user-defined ranges. If left unspecified, ports will be
chosen randomly from the unprivileged port range (1024-65535).

Default Checkpoint Storage
==========================

See :ref:`checkpoint-storage-configuration` for details.

.. _telemetry:

Telemetry
=========

By default, the master and WebUI collect anonymous information about how
Determined is being used. This usage information is collected so that we
can improve the design of the product. Determined does not report
information that can be used to identify individual users of the
product, nor does it include model source code, model
architecture/checkpoints, training datasets, training and validation
metrics, logs, or hyperparameter values.

The information we collect from the master periodically includes:

-  a unique, randomly generated ID for the current database and for the
   current instance of the master
-  the version of Determined
-  the version of Go that was used to compile the master
-  the number of registered :ref:`users <users>`
-  the number of experiments that have been created
-  the total number of trials across all experiments
-  the number of active, paused, completed, and canceled experiments

We also record when the following events happen:

-  an experiment is created
-  an experiment's state changes
-  an agent connects or disconnects
-  a user is created (the username is not transmitted)

When an experiment is created, we report:

-  the ``searcher`` and ``resources`` sections of the experiment config
-  the name of the container image used
-  the total number of hyperparameters
-  the value of the ``scheduling_unit`` configuration setting

When an experiment terminates, we report:

-  the number of trials in the experiment
-  the total number of training workloads across all trials in the
   experiment
-  the total elapsed time for all workloads across all trials in the
   experiment

The information we collect from the WebUI includes:

-  pages that are visited
-  errors that occur (both network errors and uncaught exceptions)
-  user-triggered actions

To disable telemetry reporting in both the master and the WebUI, start
the master with the ``--telemetry-enabled=false`` flag (this can also be
done by editing the master config file or setting an environment
variable, as with any other configuration option). Disabling telemetry
reporting will not affect the functionality of Determined in any way.

.. _master-configuration:

**********************
 Master Configuration
**********************

The Determined master supports a range of configuration settings that
can be set via a :ref:`YAML configuration file <topic-guides_yaml>`,
environment variables, or command-line options. The configuration file
is normally located at ``/etc/determined/master.yaml`` on the master and
is read when the master starts.

The configuration of an active master can be examined using the
Determined CLI with the command ``det master config``.

The master supports the following configuration settings:

-  ``config_file``: Path to the master configuration file. Normally this
   should only be set via an environment variable or command-line
   option. Defaults to ``/etc/determined/master.yaml``.

-  ``scheduler``: Specifies how Determined schedules tasks to agents.

   -  ``fit``: The scheduling policy to use when assigning tasks to
      agents in the cluster. Defaults to ``best``.

      -  ``best``: The best-fit policy ensures that tasks will be
         preferentially "packed" together on the smallest number of
         agents.

      -  ``worst``: The worst-fit policy ensures that tasks will be
         placed on under-utilized agents.

   -  ``type``: The scheduling policy to use when allocating resources
      between different tasks (experiments, notebooks, etc.). Defaults
      to ``fair_share``.

      -  ``fair_share``: Tasks receive a proportional amount of the
         available resources depending on the resource they require and
         their weight.

      -  ``priority``: Tasks are scheduled in the order of the order in
         which they arrive at the cluster.

   -  ``resource_provider``: The resource provider to use to acquire
      agents. Defaults to the default resource provider.

      -  ``type: default``: The default resource provider includes
         static and dynamic agents.

      -  ``type: kubernetes``: The ``kubernetes`` resource provider
         launches tasks on a Kubernetes cluster. The Determined master
         must be running within the Kubernetes cluster. When using the
         ``kubernetes`` resource provider, we recommend deploying
         Determined using the :ref:`Determined Helm Chart
         <install-on-kubernetes>`. When installed via Helm, the
         configuration settings below will be set automatically.

         -  ``namespace``: The namespace where Determined will deploy
            Pods and ConfigMaps.

         -  ``max_slots_per_pod``: Each multi-GPU (distributed training)
            task will be scheduled as a set of ``slots_per_task /
            max_slots_per_pod`` separate pods, with each pod assigned up
            to ``max_slots_per_pod`` GPUs. Distributed tasks with sizes
            that are not divisible by ``max_slots_per_pod`` are never
            scheduled. If you have a cluster of different size nodes,
            set ``max_slots_per_pod`` to the smallest common
            denominator. For example, if you have nodes with 4 GPUs and
            other nodes with 8 GPUs, set ``max_slots_per_pod`` to 4 so
            that all distributed experiments will launch with 4 GPUs per
            pod (e.g., on nodes with 8 GPUs, two such pods would be
            launched).

         -  ``master_service_name``: The service account Determined uses
            to interact with the Kubernetes API.

-  ``port``: The TCP port on which the master accepts all incoming
   connections. Defaults to ``8080``.

-  ``task_container_defaults``: Specifies Docker defaults for all task
   containers. A task represents a single schedulable unit, such as a
   trial, command, or tensorboard.

   -  ``shm_size_bytes``: The size (in bytes) of ``/dev/shm`` for
      Determined task containers. Defaults to ``4294967296``.

   -  ``network_mode``: The Docker network to use for the Determined
      task containers. If this is set to ``host``, `Docker host-mode
      networking <https://docs.docker.com/network/host/>`__ will be used
      instead. Defaults to ``bridge``.

   -  ``dtrain_network_interface``: The network interface to use during
      :ref:`multi-gpu-training`. If not set, Determined automatically
      determines the network interface to use.

      When training a model with multiple machines, the host network
      interface used by each machine must have the same interface name
      across machines. The network interface to use can be determined
      automatically, but there may be issues if there is an interface
      name common to all machines but it is not routable between
      machines. Determined already filters out common interfaces like
      ``lo`` and ``docker0``, but agent machines may have others. If
      interface detection is not finding the appropriate interface, the
      ``dtrain_network_interface`` option can be used to set it
      explicitly (e.g., ``eth11``).

   -  ``nccl_port_range``: The range of ports that NCCL is permitted to
      use during distributed training. A valid port range is in the
      format of ``MIN:MAX``. By default, no restrictions are placed on
      the NCCL port range.

   -  ``gloo_port_range``: The range of ports that Gloo is permitted to
      use during distributed training. A valid port range is in the
      format of ``MIN:MAX``. By default, no restrictions are placed on
      the Gloo port range.

   -  ``cpu_pod_spec``: Defines the default pod spec which will be
      applied to all CPU-only tasks when running on Kubernetes. See
      :ref:`custom-pod-specs` for details.

   -  ``gpu_pod_spec``: Defines the default pod spec which will be
      applied to all GPU tasks when running on Kubernetes. See
      :ref:`custom-pod-specs` for details.

   -  ``image``: Defines the default docker image to use when executing
      the workload. If a docker image is specified in the
      :ref:`experiment config <exp-environment-image>` this default is
      overriden. This image must be accessible via ``docker pull`` to
      every Determined agent machine in the cluster. Users can use
      different container images for GPU vs. CPU agents differently by
      specifying a dict with two keys, ``cpu`` and ``gpu``. Default
      values:

      -  ``determinedai/environments:py-3.6.9-pytorch-1.4-tf-1.15-cpu-0.7.0``
         for CPU agents
      -  ``determinedai/environments:cuda-10.0-pytorch-1.4-tf-1.15-gpu-0.7.0``
         for GPU agents.

   -  ``force_pull_image``: Defines the default policy for forcibly
      pulling images from the docker registry and bypassing the docker
      cache. If a pull policy is specified in the :ref:`experiment
      config <exp-environment-image>` this default value is overriden.
      Please note that as of November 1st, 2020 unauthenticated users
      will be `capped at 100 pulls from Docker per 6 hours
      <https://www.docker.com/blog/scaling-docker-to-serve-millions-more-developers-network-egress/>`__.
      Defaults to ``false``.

   -  ``registry_auth``: Defines the default `docker registry
      credentials
      <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.30/#operation/SystemAuth>`__
      to use when pulling a custom base docker image, if needed. If
      credentials are specified is in the :ref:`experiment config
      <exp-environment-image>` this default value is overriden.
      Credentials are specified as the following nested fields:

      -  ``username`` (required)
      -  ``password`` (required)
      -  ``server`` (optional)
      -  ``email`` (optional)

-  ``root``: Specifies the root directory of the state files. Defaults
   to ``/usr/share/determined/master``.

-  ``cluster_name`` (optional): Specify a human readable name for this
   cluster.

-  ``tensorboard_timeout``: Specifies the duration in seconds before
   idle TensorBoard instances are automatically terminated. A
   TensorBoard instance is considered to be idle if it does not receive
   any HTTP traffic. The default timeout is ``300`` (5 minutes).

-  ``provisioner``: Specifies the configuration of dynamic agents.

   -  ``master_url``: The full URL of the master. A valid URL is in the
      format of ``scheme://host:port``. The scheme must be either
      ``http`` or ``https``. If the master is deployed on EC2, rather
      than hardcoding the IP address, we advise you use one of the
      following to set the host as an alias: ``local-ipv4``,
      ``public-ipv4``, ``local-hostname``, or ``public-hostname``. If
      the master is deployed on GCP, rather than hardcoding the IP
      address, we advise you use one of the following to set the host as
      an alias: ``internal-ip`` or ``external-ip``. Which one you should
      select is based on your network configuration. On master startup,
      we will replace the above alias host with its real value. Defaults
      to ``http`` as scheme, local IP address as host, and ``8080`` as
      port.

   -  ``startup_script``: One or more shell commands that will be run
      during agent instance start up. These commands are executed as
      root as soon as the agent cloud instance has started and before
      the Determined agent container on the instance is launched. For
      example, this feature can be used to mount a distributed file
      system or make changes to the agent instance's configuration. The
      default value is the empty string. It may be helpful to use the
      YAML ``|`` syntax to specify a multi-line string. For example,

      .. code::

         startup_script: |
                         mkdir -p /mnt/disks/second
                         mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/disks/second

   -  ``container_startup_script``: One or more shell commands that will
      be run when the Determined agent container is started. These
      commands are executed inside the agent container but before the
      Determined agent itself is launched. For example, this feature can
      be used to configure Docker so that the agent can pull task images
      from GCR securely (see :ref:`this example <gcp-pull-gcr>` for more
      details). The default value is the empty string.

   -  ``agent_docker_image``: The Docker image to use for the Determined

      ``determinedai/determined-agent:<version>``. (*Required*)

   -  ``agent_docker_network``: The Docker network to use for the
      Determined agent and task containers. If this is set to ``host``,
      `Docker host-mode networking
      <https://docs.docker.com/network/host/>`__ will be used instead.
      The default value is ``determined``.

   -  ``agent_docker_runtime``: The Docker runtime to use for the
      Determined agent and task containers. Defaults to ``runc``.

   -  ``max_idle_agent_period``: How long to wait before terminating
      idle dynamic agents. This string is a sequence of decimal numbers,
      each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "30s",
      "1h", or "1m30s". Valid time units are "s", "m", "h". The default
      value is ``20m``.

   -  ``max_agent_starting_period``: How long to wait for agents
      starting before retrying. This string is a sequence of decimal
      numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as
      "30s", "1h", or "1m30s". Valid time units are "s", "m", "h". The
      default value is ``20m``.

   -  ``provider: aws``: Specifies running dynamic agents on AWS.
      (*Required*)

      -  ``region``: The region of the AWS resources used by Determined.

            to ``false``.

         -  ``security_group_id``: The ID of the security group to run
            the Determined agents as. This should be the security group
            you identified or created in

      -  ``spot_max_price``: Optional field indicating the maximum price
         per hour that you are willing to pay for a spot instance. The
         market price for a spot instance varies based on supply and
         demand. If the market price exceeds the ``spot_max_price``,
         Determined will not launch instances. This field must be a
         string and must not include a currency sign. For example, $2.50
         should be represented as ``"2.50"``. Defaults to the on-demand

         for details.

      -  ``project``: The project ID of the GCP resources used by
         Determined. Defaults to the project of the master.

      -  ``zone``: The zone of the GCP resources used by Determined.
         Defaults to the zone of the master.

      -  ``boot_disk_size``: Size of the root volume of the Determined
         agent in GB. We recommend at least 100GB. Defaults to ``200``.

      -  ``boot_disk_source_image``: The boot disk source image of the
         Determined agent that was shared with you. To use a specific
         version of the Determined agent image from a specific project,
         it should be set in the format:
         ``projects/<project-id>/global/images/<image-id>``. Defaults to
         the latest GCP agent image. (*Optional*)

      -  ``label_key``: Key for labeling the Determined agent instances.

         the master instance name if the master is on GCP otherwise
         ``determined-ai-determined``.

      -  ``network_interface``: Network configuration for the Determined
         agent instances. See the :ref:`gcp-api-access` section for the
         suggested configuration. (*Required*)

         -  ``network``: Network resource for the Determined agent
            instances. The network configuration should specify the
            project ID of the network. It should be set in the format:
            ``projects/<project>/global/networks/<network>``.
            (*Required*)

         -  ``subnetwork``: Subnetwork resource for the Determined agent
            instances. The subnet configuration should specify the
            project ID and the region of the subnetwork. It should be
            set in the format:
            ``projects/<project>/regions/<region>/subnetworks/<subnetwork>``.
            (*Required*)

         -  ``external_ip``: Whether to use external IP addresses for

         -  ``gpu_type``: Type of GPU for the Determined agents. Set it
            to be an empty string to not use any GPUs. Defaults to
            ``nvidia-tesla-v100``.

         -  ``gpu_num``: Number of GPUs for the Determined agents.
            Defaults to 4.

         -  ``preemptible``: Whether to use preemptible instances.
            Defaults to ``false``.

      -  ``min_instances``: Min number of Determined agent instances.
         Defaults to 0.

      -  ``max_instances``: Max number of Determined agent instances.
         Defaults to 5.

      -  ``operation_timeout_period``: The timeout period for tracking a
         GCP operation. This string is a sequence of decimal numbers,
         each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "30s",
         "1h", or "1m30s". Valid time units are "s", "m", "h". The
         default value is ``5m``.

-  ``checkpoint_storage``: Specifies where model checkpoints will be
   stored. This can be overridden on a per-experiment basis in the
   :ref:`experiment-configuration`. A checkpoint contains the
   architecture and weights of the model being trained. Determined
   currently supports four kinds of checkpoint storage, ``gcs``,
   ``hdfs``, ``s3``, and ``shared_fs``, identified by the ``type``
   subfield.

   -  ``type: gcs``: Checkpoints are stored on Google Cloud Storage
      (GCS). Authentication is done using GCP's "`Application Default
      Credentials
      <https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/auth.html>`__"
      approach. When using Determined inside Google Compute Engine
      (GCE), the simplest approach is to ensure that the VMs used by
      Determined are running in a service account that has the "Storage
      Object Admin" role on the GCS bucket being used for checkpoints.
      As an alternative (or when running outside of GCE), you can add
      the appropriate `service account credentials
      <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#obtaining_and_providing_service_account_credentials_manually>`__
      to your container (e.g., via a bind-mount), and then set the
      ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable to the
      container path where the credentials are located. See
      :ref:`environment-variables` for more information on how to set
      environment variables in trial environments.

      -  ``bucket``: The GCS bucket name to use.

   -  ``type: hdfs``: Checkpoints are stored in HDFS using the `WebHDFS
      <http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/WebHDFS.html>`__
      API for reading and writing checkpoint resources.

      -  ``hdfs_url``: Hostname or IP address of HDFS namenode, prefixed
         with protocol, followed by WebHDFS port on namenode. Multiple
         namenodes are allowed as a semicolon-separated list (e.g.,
         ``"http://namenode1:50070;http://namenode2:50070"``).

      -  ``hdfs_path``: The prefix path where all checkpoints will be
         written to and read from. The resources of each checkpoint will
         be saved in a subdirectory of ``hdfs_path``, where the
         subdirectory name is the checkpoint's UUID.

      -  ``user``: An optional string value that indicates the user to
         use for all read and write requests. If left unspecified, the
         default user of the trial runner container will be used.

   -  ``type: s3``: Checkpoints are stored in Amazon S3.

      -  ``bucket``: The S3 bucket name to use.
      -  ``access_key``: The AWS access key to use.
      -  ``secret_key``: The AWS secret key to use.
      -  ``endpoint_url``: The optional endpoint to use for S3 clones,
         e.g., ``http://127.0.0.1:8080/``.

   -  ``type: shared_fs``: Checkpoints are written to a directory on the
      agent's file system. The assumption is that the system
      administrator has arranged for the same directory to be mounted at
      every agent host, and for the content of this directory to be the
      same on all agent hosts (e.g., by using a distributed or network
      file system such as GlusterFS or NFS).

      -  ``host_path``: The file system path on each agent to use. This
         directory will be mounted to ``/determined_shared_fs`` inside
         the trial container.

      -  ``storage_path``: The optional path where checkpoints will be
         written to and read from. Must be a subdirectory of the
         ``host_path`` or an absolute path containing the ``host_path``.
         If unset, checkpoints are written to and read from the
         ``host_path``.

      -  ``propagation``: (Advanced users only) Optional `propagation
         behavior
         <https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation>`__
         for replicas of the bind-mount. Defaults to ``rprivate``.

   -  When an experiment finishes, the system will optionally delete
      some checkpoints to reclaim space. The ``save_experiment_best``,
      ``save_trial_best`` and ``save_trial_latest`` parameters specify
      which checkpoints to save. See
      :ref:`checkpoint-garbage-collection` for more details.

-  ``db``: Specifies the configuration of the database.

   -  ``user``: The database user to use when logging in the database.
      (*Required*)
   -  ``password``: The password to use when logging in the database.
      (*Required*)
   -  ``host``: The database host to use. (*Required*)
   -  ``port``: The database port to use. (*Required*)
   -  ``name``: The database name to use. (*Required*)

-  ``security``: Specifies security-related configuration settings.

   -  ``tls``: Specifies configuration settings for :ref:`TLS <tls>`.
      TLS is enabled if certificate and key files are both specified.

      -  ``cert``: Certificate file to use for serving TLS.
      -  ``key``: Key file to use for serving TLS.

-  ``telemetry``: Specifies whether we collect and report anonymous
   information about the usage of Determined. See :ref:`telemetry` for
   details on what kinds of information are reported.

   -  ``enabled``: Whether telemetry is enabled. Defaults to ``true``.

.. _agent-configuration:

*********************
 Agent Configuration
*********************

-  ``config_file``: Path to the agent configuration file. Normally this
   should only be set via an environment variable or command-line
   option. Defaults to ``/etc/determined/agent.yaml``.

-  ``master_host`` (required): The hostname or IP address of the
   Determined master.

-  ``master_port``: The port of the Determined master. Defaults to
   ``443`` if TLS is enabled and ``80`` otherwise.

-  ``agent_id``: The ID of this agent; defaults to the hostname of the
   current machine. Agent IDs must be unique within a cluster.

-  ``container-master-host``: Master hostname that containers started by
   this agent will connect to. Defaults to the value of ``master_host``.

-  ``container-master-port``: Master port that containers started by
   this agent will connect to. Defaults to the value of ``master_port``.

-  ``label``: The label to assign to this agent. An agent with a label
   will only be assigned workloads that have been assigned the same
   label (e.g., via the :ref:`agent_label <exp-config-agent_label>`
   field in the experiment configuration).

-  ``visible_gpus``: The GPUs that should be exposed as slots by the
   agent. A comma-separated list of GPUs, each specified by a 0-based
   index, UUID, PCI bus ID, or board serial number. The 0-based index of
   NVIDIA GPUs can be obtained via the ``nvidia-smi`` command.

-  ``slot_type``: The slot type that should be exposed. All the dynamic
   agents are configured to ``gpu`` while for other agents this field
   defaults to ``auto``.

   -  ``auto``: Automatically detects the slot type. The agent will
      detect if there are GPUs. If there are GPUs, it maps each GPU to
      one slot. Otherwise, It creates a slot for all the CPUs.

   -  ``cpu``: The agent will map all the CPUs to a slot.

   -  ``gpu``: The agent will map each GPU to a slot.

-  ``http_proxy``: The HTTP proxy address for the agent's containers.

-  ``https_proxy``: The HTTPS proxy address for the agent's containers.

-  ``ftp_proxy``: The FTP proxy address for the agent's containers.

-  ``no_proxy``: The addresses that the agent's containers should not
   proxy.

-  ``security``: Security-related configuration settings.

   -  ``tls``: Configuration settings for :ref:`TLS <tls>`.

      -  ``enabled``: Whether to use TLS to connect to the master.
         Defaults to ``false``.

      -  ``skip_verify``: Skip verifying the master certificate when
         using TLS. Defaults to ``false``. Enabling this setting will
         reduce the security of your Determined cluster.

      -  ``master_cert``: CA cert file for the master when using TLS.
