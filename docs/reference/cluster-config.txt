Cluster Configuration
=====================

For both the master and the agent, configuration options may be set
using a configuration file, environment variables, or command-line
options. (Although values from different sources will be merged, we
generally recommend sticking to a single source for each service to keep
things simple.)

Both the master and the agent can be configured using a configuration file by
passing the ``--config-file`` command-line option as shown below.

.. code::

  docker run \
    -v `pwd`/agent-config.yaml:/etc/determined/agent-config.yaml \
    determinedai/determined-agent
    --config-file /etc/determined/agent-config.yaml

Each option in the configuration file corresponds directly to an
environment variable or command-line option. For example, the master
configuration file might contain

.. code:: yaml

   db:
     host: the-db-host


to configure the host where the PostgreSQL database is running. The same
thing could be done by starting the master with the
``DET_DB_HOST=the-db-host`` environment variable or ``--db-host
the-db-host`` command-line option.

The agent configuration file might contain

.. code:: yaml

  master_address: 127.0.0.1
  master_port: 8080

to configure the address of the Determined master.

In the rest of this document, we will refer to options using their names
in the configuration file. Periods (``.``) will be used to indicate
nested options; for example, the option above would be indicated by
``db.host``.

Common Options
--------------

Master Port
~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the master listens on TCP port 8080. This can be configured
via the ``http_port`` option.

.. _security:

Security
~~~~~~~~

The master is capable of serving over HTTPS in addition to HTTP. Doing
so requires a TLS private key and certificate; to configure them, set
the options ``security.tls.cert`` and ``security.tls.key`` to paths to a
PEM-encoded TLS certificate and private key, respectively. The
``https_port`` option determines the HTTPS listening port (default
8443).

.. _agent-network-proxy:

Configuring Trial Runner Networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The master is capable of selecting the network interface that trial
runners will use to communicate when performing distributed
(multi-machine) training. The network interface can be configured by
editing the ``task_container_defaults.dtrain_network_interface``. If left unspecified,
which is the default setting, Determined will auto-discover a common
network interface shared by the trial runners.

.. note::
    For :ref:`multi-gpu-training`, Determined automatically detects a
    common network interface shared by the agent machines. If your
    cluster has multiple common network interfaces, please specify the
    fastest one.

Additionally, the ports used by the GLOO and NCCL libraries, which are
used during distributed (multi-machine) training can be configured to
fall within user-defined ranges. If left unspecified, ports will be
chosen randomly from the unprivileged port range (1024-65535).

Default Checkpoint Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`checkpoint-storage-configuration` for details.

Telemetry
~~~~~~~~~

By default, the master and WebUI collect anonymous information about how
Determined is being used. This usage information is collected so that we
can improve the design of the product. Determined does not report
information that can be used to identify individual users of the
product, nor does it include model source code, model
architecture/checkpoints, training datasets, training and validation
metrics, logs, or hyperparameter values.

The information we collect from the master periodically includes:

- a unique, randomly generated ID for the current database and for the
  current instance of the master
- the version of Determined
- the version of Go that was used to compile the master
- the number of registered :ref:`users <users>`
- the number of experiments that have been created
- the total number of trials across all experiments
- the number of active, paused, completed, and canceled experiments

We also record when the following events happen:

- an experiment is created
- an experiment's state changes
- an agent connects or disconnects
- a user is created (the username is not transmitted)

When an experiment is created, we report:

- the ``searcher`` and ``resources`` sections of the experiment config
- the name of the container image used
- the total number of hyperparameters
- the value of the ``batches_per_step`` configuration setting

When an experiment terminates, we report:

- the number of trials in the experiment
- the total number of steps across all trials in the experiment
- the total elapsed time for all steps across all trials in the experiment

The information we collect from the WebUI includes:

- pages that are visited
- errors that occur (both network errors and uncaught exceptions)
- user-triggered actions

In order to disable telemetry reporting in both the master and the
WebUI, start the master with the ``--telemetry-enabled=false`` flag
(this can also be done by editing the master config file or setting an
environment variable, as with any other configuration option).
Disabling telemetry reporting will not affect the functionality of
Determined in any way.

Master Configuration
====================

The Determined master supports a range of configuration settings that
can be set via a :ref:`YAML configuration file <topic-guides_yaml>`,
environment variables, or command-line options. The configuration file
is normally located at ``/etc/determined/master.yaml`` on the master and
is read when the master starts.

The master supports the following configuration settings:

- ``scheduler``: Specifies how Determined schedules tasks to agents.

  - ``fit``: The scheduling policy to use when assigning tasks to
    agents in the cluster.

    - ``best``: The best-fit policy ensures that tasks will be
      preferentially "packed" together on the smallest number of
      agents.

    - ``worst``: The worst-fit policy ensures that tasks will be
      placed on under-utilized agents.

- ``task_container_defaults``: Specifies Docker defaults for all task containers. A task represents a single schedulable unit, like a trial, command or tensorboard.

  - ``shm_size_bytes``: The size (in bytes) of ``/dev/shm`` for Determined task containers. Defaults to ``4294967296``.

  - ``network_mode``: The Docker network to use for the Determined task containers.
    If this is set to "host", Docker host-mode networking will be used
    instead. Defaults to "bridge".

  - ``dtrain_network_interface``: The network interface to use during
    :ref:`multi-gpu-training`. If not set, Determined automatically determines
    the network interface.

    When training a model with multiple machines, the host network
    interface used by each machine must have the same interface name
    across machines. This is usually determined automatically, but there
    may be issues if there is an interface name common to all machines
    but it is not routable between machines. Determined already filters out
    common interfaces like ``lo`` and ``docker0``, but agent machines
    may have others.

    If interface detection is not finding the appropriate interface, the
    ``dtrain_network_interface`` option can be used to set it explicitly (e.g.,
    ``eth11``).

  - ``nccl_port_range``: The range of ports that nccl is permitted to use
    during distributed training. A valid port range is in the format of
    ``MIN:MAX``.

  - ``gloo_port_range``: The range of ports that gloo is permitted to use
    during distributed training. A valid port range is in the format of
    ``MIN:MAX``.

- ``root``: Specifies the root directory of the state files. Defaults to
  ``/usr/share/determined/master``.

- ``provisioner``: Specifies the configuration of dynamic agents.

  - ``master_url``: The full URL of the master. A valid URL is in the
    format of ``scheme://host:port``. The scheme must be either
    ``http`` or ``https``. If the master is deployed on EC2, rather
    than hardcoding the IP address, we advise you use one of the
    following to set the host as an alias: ``local-ipv4``,
    ``public-ipv4``, ``local-hostname``, or ``public-hostname``. If
    the master is deployed on GCP, rather than hardcoding the IP
    address, we advise you use one of the following to set the host as
    an alias: ``internal-ip`` or\ ``external-ip``. Which one you
    should select is based on your network configuration. On master
    startup, we will replace the above alias host with its real value.
    Defaults to ``http`` as scheme, local IP address as host, and
    ``8080`` as port.

  - ``startup_script``: Startup script for the node the agent runs on.
    This script will run right away when agent instances start up.
    For example, it can be used for formatting and mounting a disk. Defaults
    to an empty string.

  - ``container_startup_script``: Startup script for the container
    ``determined-agent`` runs in. This script will run right away when
    the agent's container starts up. For example, this script can be used
    to configure docker so the agent can pull task images from GCR securely.

  - ``agent_docker_network``: The Docker network to use for the Determined
    agent and task containers. If this is set to "host", Docker
    host-mode networking will be used instead. The default value is
    "determined".

  - ``agent_docker_runtime``: The Docker runtime to use for the Determined
    agent and task containers. Defaults to ``runc``.

  - ``agent_docker_image``: The Docker image to use for the Determined agents.
    A valid form is ``determinedai/determined-agent:<version>``. (*Required*)

  - ``max_idle_agent_period``: How long to wait before terminating idle
    dynamic agents. This string is a sequence of decimal numbers, each
    with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "30s", "1h", or
    "1m30s". Valid time units are "s", "m", "h".

  - ``provider: aws``: Specifies running dynamic agents on AWS.
    (*Required*)

    - ``region``: The region of the AWS resources used by Determined. We
      advise setting this region to be the same region as the Determined

      region as the master.

    - ``root_volume_size``: Size of the root volume of the Determined agent
      in GB. We recommend at least 100GB. Defaults to ``200``.

      - ``security_group_id``: The ID of the security group to run the Determined
        agents as. This is the one you identified or created in
        :ref:`aws-network-requirements`. Defaults to the default security
        group of the specified VPC.

      - ``subnet_id``: The ID of the subnet to run the Determined agents
        in. Defaults to the default subnet of the default VPC.

    - ``max_instances``: Max number of Determined agent instances. Defaults
      to ``5``.

      in GB. We recommend at least 100GB. Defaults to ``200``.

    - ``boot_disk_source_image``: The boot disk source image of the
      Determined agent that was shared with you. To use a specific version
      of the Determined agent image from a specific project, it should be
      set in the format:
      ``projects/<project-id>/global/images/<image-id>``.
      (*Required*)

    - ``label_key``: Key for labeling the Determined agent instances.
      Defaults to ``managed-by``.

    - ``label_value``: Value for labeling the Determined agent instances.
      Defaults to the master instance name if the master is on GCP
      otherwise ``determined-ai-determined``.

    - ``name_prefix``: Name prefix to set for the Determined agent
      instances. The names of the Determined agent instances are a
      concatenation of the name prefix and a pet name. Defaults to
      the master instance name if the master is on GCP otherwise
      ``determined-ai-determined``.

    - ``network_interface``: Network configuration for the Determined agent
      instances. See the :ref:`gcp-api-access`
      section for the suggested configuration. (*Required*)

      - ``network``: Network resource for the Determined agent instances.
        The network configuration should specify the project ID of
        the network. It should be set in the format:
        ``projects/<project>/global/networks/<network>``.
        (*Required*)

      - ``subnetwork``: Subnetwork resource for the Determined agent
        instances. The subnet configuration should specify the
        project ID and the region of the subnetwork. It should be
        set in the format:
        ``projects/<project>/regions/<region>/subnetworks/<subnetwork>``.
        (*Required*)

      - ``external_ip``: Flag to using external IP address for the
        Determined agent instances. See :ref:`gcp-network-requirements`
        for instructions on whether an external IP should be set.
        Defaults to ``false``.

    - ``network_tags``: An array of network tags to set firewalls for
      the Determined agent instances. This is the one you identified or
      created in :ref:`firewall-rules`.  Defaults to be an empty array.

      instances. See the :ref:`gcp-api-access` section for suggested
      configuration.

      - ``email``: Email of the service account for the Determined agent
        instances. Defaults to the empty string.

      - ``scopes``: List of scopes authorized for the Determined agent
        instances. As suggested in :ref:`gcp-api-access`,
        we recommend you set the scopes to
        ``["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"]``.
        Defaults to

        Defaults to ``n1-standard-32``.

      - ``gpu_type``: Type of GPU for the Determined agents. Defaults to
        ``nvidia-tesla-v100``.

      - ``gpu_num``: Number of GPUs for the Determined agents. Defaults to
        4.

      - ``preemptible``: Whether to use preemptible instances. Defaults to
        ``false``.

    - ``max_instances``: Max number of Determined agent instances. Defaults
      to 5.

- ``checkpoint_storage``: Specifies where model checkpoints will be
  stored. This can be overridden on a per-experiment basis in the
  :ref:`experiment-configuration`. A checkpoint contains the
  architecture and weights of the model being trained. Determined currently
  supports four kinds of checkpoint storage, ``gcs``, ``hdfs``, ``s3``,
  and ``shared_fs``, identified by the ``type`` subfield.

  - ``type: gcs``: Checkpoints are stored on Google Cloud Storage
    (GCS). Authentication is done using GCP's "`Application Default
    Credentials <https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/auth.html>`__"
    approach. When using Determined inside Google Compute Engine (GCE), the
    simplest approach is to ensure that the VMs used by Determined are
    running in a service account that has the "Storage Object Admin"
    role on the GCS bucket being used for checkpoints. As an
    alternative (or when running outside of GCE), you can add the
    appropriate `service account
    credentials <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#obtaining_and_providing_service_account_credentials_manually>`__
    to your container (e.g., via a bind-mount), and then set the
    ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable to the
    container path where the credentials are located. See :ref:`environment-variables`
    for more information on how to set environment variables in trial environments.

    - ``bucket``: The GCS bucket name to use.

  - ``type: hdfs``: Checkpoints are stored in HDFS using the
    `WebHDFS <http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/WebHDFS.html>`__
    API for reading and writing checkpoint resources.

    - ``hdfs_url``: Hostname or IP address of HDFS namenode, prefixed
      with protocol, followed by WebHDFS port on namenode. Multiple
      namenodes are allowed as a semicolon-separated list (e.g.,
      ``"http://namenode1:50070;http://namenode2:50070"``).
    - ``hdfs_path``: The prefix path where all checkpoints will be
      written to and read from. The resources of each checkpoint will
      be saved in a subdirectory of ``hdfs_path``, where the
      subdirectory name is the checkpoint's UUID.
    - ``user``: An optional string value that indicates the user to
      use for all read and write requests. If left unspecified, the
      default user of the trial runner container will be used.

  - ``type: s3``: Checkpoints are stored in Amazon S3.

    - ``bucket``: The S3 bucket name to use.
    - ``access_key``: The AWS access key to use.
    - ``secret_key``: The AWS secret key to use.
    - ``endpoint_url``: The optional endpoint to use for S3 clones,
      e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080/.

  - ``type: shared_fs``: Checkpoints are written to a directory on the
    agent's file system. The assumption is that the system
    administrator has arranged for the same directory to be mounted at
    every agent host, and for the content of this directory to be the
    same on all agent hosts (e.g., by using a distributed or network
    file system such as GlusterFS or NFS).

    - ``host_path``: The file system path on each agent to use. This
      directory will be mounted to ``/determined_shared_fs`` inside the
      trial container.
    - ``storage_path``: The optional path where checkpoints will be
      written to and read from. Must be a subdirectory of the
      ``host_path`` or an absolute path containing the ``host_path``.
      If unset, checkpoints are written to and read from the
      ``host_path``.
    - ``propagation``: (Advanced users only) Optional `propagation
      behavior <https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation>`__
      for replicas of the bind-mount. Defaults to ``rprivate``.

  - When an experiment finishes, the system will optionally delete some
    checkpoints to reclaim space. The ``save_experiment_best``,
    ``save_trial_best`` and ``save_trial_latest`` parameters specify which
    checkpoints to save. See :ref:`checkpoint-garbage-collection` for more
    details.

- ``db``: Specifies the configuration of the database.

  - ``user``: The database user to use when logging in the database. (*Required*)
  - ``password``: The password to use when logging in the database. (*Required*)
  - ``host``: The database host to use. (*Required*)
  - ``port``: The database port to use. (*Required*)
  - ``name``: The database name to use. (*Required*)

- ``hasura``: Specifies the connection to Hasura.

  - ``address``: The address of the host where Hasura is running. A valid
    address is in the form of ``host:port``. Defaults to ``localhost:8081``.
  - ``secret``: The `Hasura secret
    <https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.html#command-flags>`__
    to use. Defaults to an empty string.

- ``telemetry``: Specifies whether we collect anonymous information about the
  usage of Determined.

  - ``enabled``: Whether collection is enabled. Defaults to ``true``.

Agent Configuration
===================

- ``master_address`` (required): The hostname or IP address of the Determined master.
- ``master_port`` (required): The port of the Determined master.
- ``agent_id``: The ID of this agent; defaults to the hostname of the current
  machine. Agent IDs must be unique within a cluster.
- ``label``: An agent with a label will only be assigned workloads that have been assigned the same label.
- ``visible_gpus``: The GPUs that should be exposed as slots by the agent. A comma-separated list of GPUs,
  each specified by a 0-based index, UUID, PCI bus ID, or board serial number.
  The 0-based index of NVIDIA GPUs can be obtained via the ``nvidia-smi``
  command.
