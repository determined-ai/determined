 Determined Task Configuration
###############################

The behavior of Determined tasks, such as :ref:`TensorBoards
<how-to-tensorboard>`, :ref:`notebooks <how-to-notebooks>`,
:ref:`commands, and shells <commands-and-shells>`, can be influenced by
setting a variety of configuration variables. These configuration
variables are similar but not identical to the configuration options
supported by :ref:`experiments <experiment-configuration>`.

Configuration settings can be specified by passing a YAML configuration
file when launching the workload via the Determined CLI:

.. code::

   $ det tensorboard start experiment_id --config-file=my_config.yaml
   $ det notebook start --config-file=my_config.yaml
   $ det cmd run --config-file=my_config.yaml ...
   $ det shell start --config-file=my_config.yaml

Configuration variables can also be set directly on the command line
when any Determined task, except a TensorBoard, is launched:

.. code::

   $ det notebook start --config resources.slots=2
   $ det cmd run --config description="determined_command" ...
   $ det shell start --config resources.priority=1

Options set via ``--config`` take precedence over values specified in
the configuration file. Configuration settings are compatible with any
Determined task unless otherwise specified.

************************
 Configuration Settings
************************

The following configuration settings are supported:

-  ``description``: A human-readable description of the task. This does
   not need to be unique. The default description consists of a
   timestamp and the entrypoint of the command.

-  ``environment``: Specifies the environment of the container that is
   used to execute the task.

   -  ``image``: Specifies a Docker image to use when executing the
      workload. The image must be available via ``docker pull`` to every
      Determined agent machine in the cluster. Users can customize the
      image used for GPU vs. CPU agents by specifying a dict with two
      keys, ``cpu`` and ``gpu``. Defaults to
      ``determinedai/environments:py-3.7-pytorch-1.7-tf-1.15-cpu-0.12.0``
      for CPU agents and
      ``determinedai/environments:cuda-10.2-pytorch-1.7-tf-1.15-gpu-0.12.0``
      for GPU agents.

   -  ``force_pull_image``: Forcibly pull the image from the Docker
      registry and bypass the Docker cache. Defaults to ``false``.

   -  ``environment_variables``: Specifies a list of environment
      variables for the container. Each element of the list should be a
      string of the form ``NAME=VALUE``. See
      :ref:`environment-variables` for more details. Users can customize
      environment variables for GPU vs. CPU agents differently by
      specifying a dict with two keys, ``cpu`` and ``gpu``.

   -  ``pod_spec``: Only applicable when running Determined on
      Kubernetes. Applies a pod spec to the pods that are launched by
      Determined for this task. See :ref:`custom-pod-specs` for details.

   -  ``registry_auth``: Specifies the `Docker registry credentials
      <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.30/#operation/SystemAuth>`__
      to use when pulling a Docker image, if needed.

      -  ``username`` (required)
      -  ``password`` (required)
      -  ``server`` (optional)
      -  ``email`` (optional)

   -  ``add_capabilities``: A list of Linux capabilities to grant to
      task containers. Each entry in the list is equivalent to a
      ``--cap-add CAP`` command line argument to ``docker run``.
      ``add_capabilities`` is honored by resource managers of type
      ``agent`` but is ignored by resource managers of type
      ``kubernetes``. See :ref:`master configuration
      <master-configuration>` for details about resource managers.

   -  ``drop_capabilities``: Just like ``add_capabilities`` but
      corresponding to the ``--cap-drop`` argument of ``docker run``
      rather than ``--cap-add``.

-  ``resources``: The resources Determined allows a task to use.

   -  ``slots``: Specifies the number of slots to use for the task. The
      default value is ``1``. The maximum value is the number of slots
      on the agent in the cluster with the most slots. For example,
      Determined will be unable to schedule a task that requests 4 slots
      if the Determined cluster is composed of agents with 2 slots each.
      The number of slots for TensorBoard is fixed at ``0`` and may not
      be changed.

   -  ``agent_label``: If set, the task will *only* be scheduled on
      agents that have the given label set. If this is not set (the
      default behavior), the task will only be scheduled on unlabeled
      agents. An agent's label can be configured via the ``label`` field
      in the :ref:`agent configuration <agent-configuration>`.

   -  ``shm_size``: The size in bytes of ``/dev/shm`` for task
      containers. Defaults to ``4294967296`` (4GiB). If set, this value
      overrides the value specified in the :ref:`master configuration
      <master-configuration>`.

   -  ``priority``: The priority assigned to this task. Tasks with
      smaller priority values are scheduled before tasks with higher
      priority values. Only applicable when using the ``priority``
      scheduler. Refer to :ref:`scheduling` for more information.

   -  ``resource_pool``: The resource pool where this task will be
      scheduled. If no resource pool is specified, CPU-only tasks will
      be scheduled in the default CPU pool, while GPU-using tasks will
      be scheduled in the default GPU tool. Refer to
      :ref:`resource-pools` for more information.

   -  ``devices``: A list of device strings to pass to the Docker
      daemon. Each entry in the list is equivalent to a ``--device
      DEVICE`` command line argument to ``docker run``. ``devices`` is
      honored by resource managers of type ``agent`` but is ignored by
      resource managers of type ``kubernetes``. See :ref:`master
      configuration <master-configuration>` for details about resource
      managers.

``resource_pool``
   The resource pool where this experiment will be scheduled. If no
   resource pool is specified, experiments will run in the default GPU
   pool. Refer to :ref:`resource-pools` for more information.

``devices``
   A list of device strings to pass to the Docker daemon. Each entry in
   the list is equivalent to a ``--device DEVICE`` command line argument
   to ``docker run``. ``devices`` is honored by resource managers of
   type ``agent`` but is ignored by resource managers of type
   ``kubernetes``. See :ref:`master configuration
   <master-configuration>` for details about resource managers.

-  ``bind_mounts``: Specifies a collection of directories that are
   bind-mounted into the Docker containers for execution. This can be
   used to allow commands to access additional data that is not
   contained in the command context. This field should consist of an
   array of entries. Note that users should ensure that the specified
   host paths are accessible on all agent hosts (e.g., by configuring a
   network file system appropriately). Defaults to an empty list.

   -  ``host_path``: (required) The file system path on each agent to
      use. Must be an absolute filepath.

   -  ``container_path``: (required) The file system path in the
      container to use. May be a relative filepath, in which case it
      will be mounted relative to the working directory inside the
      container. It is not allowed to mount directly into the working
      directory (``container_path == "."``) to reduce the risk of
      cluttering the host filesystem.

   -  ``read_only``: Whether the bind-mount should be a read-only mount.
      Defaults to ``false``.

   -  ``propagation``: (Advanced users only) Optional `propagation
      behavior
      <https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation>`__
      for replicas of the bind-mount. Defaults to ``rprivate``.

-  ``tensorboard_args``: Lists optional arguments for launching
   TensorBoard. Each element of the list should be a string of the form
   ``NAME=VALUE``.
