###############################
 Determined Task Configuration
###############################

The behavior of Determined tasks, such as TensorBoards, notebooks,
:ref:`commands, and shells <commands-and-shells>`, can be influenced by
setting a variety of configuration variables. Configuration settings can
be specified by passing a YAML configuration file when launching the
workload via the Determined CLI:

.. code::

   $ det tensorboard start experiment_id --config-file=my_config.yaml
   $ det notebook start --config-file=my_config.yaml
   $ det cmd run --config-file=my_config.yaml ...
   $ det shell start --config-file=my_config.yaml

Configuration variables can also be set directly on the command line
when any Determined task, except a TensorBoard, is launched:

.. code::

   $ det notebook start --config resources.slots=2
   $ det cmd run --config description="determined_command" ...
   $ det shell start --config resources.priority=1

Options set via ``--config`` take precedence over values specified in
the configuration file. Configuration settings are compatible with any
Determined task unless otherwise specified.

************************
 Configuration Settings
************************

The following configuration settings are supported:

-  ``description``: A human-readable description of the
   command/notebook. This does not need to be unique. The default
   description consists of a timestamp and the entrypoint of the
   command.

-  ``environment``: Specifies the environment of the container that is
   used to execute the command/notebook.

   -  ``image``: Specifies a Docker image to use when executing the
      workload. The image must be available via ``docker pull`` to every
      Determined agent machine in the cluster. Users can customize the
      image used for GPU vs. CPU agents by specifying a dict with two
      keys, ``cpu`` and ``gpu``. Defaults to
      ``determinedai/environments:py-3.6.9-pytorch-1.4-tf-1.15-cpu-0.8.0``
      for CPU agents and
      ``determinedai/environments:cuda-10.0-pytorch-1.4-tf-1.15-gpu-0.8.0``
      for GPU agents.

   -  ``force_pull_image``: Forcibly pull the image from the Docker
      registry and bypass the Docker cache. Defaults to ``false``.

   -  ``environment_variables``: Specifies a list of environment
      variables for the container. Each element of the list should be a
      string of the form ``NAME=VALUE``. See
      :ref:`environment-variables` for more details. Users can customize
      environment variables for GPU vs. CPU agents differently by
      specifying a dict with two keys, ``cpu`` and ``gpu``.

   -  ``pod_spec``: Only applicable when running Determined on
      Kubernetes. Applies a pod spec to the pods that are launched by
      Determined for this task. See :ref:`custom-pod-specs` for details.

   -  ``registry_auth``: Specifies the `Docker registry credentials
      <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.30/#operation/SystemAuth>`__
      to use when pulling a Docker image, if needed.

      -  ``username`` (required)
      -  ``password`` (required)
      -  ``server`` (optional)
      -  ``email`` (optional)

-  ``resources``: The resources Determined allows a command/notebook to
   use.

   -  ``slots``: Specifies the number of slots to use for the
      command/notebook. The default value is ``1``. The maximum value is
      the number of slots on the agent in the cluster with the most
      slots. For example, Determined will be unable to schedule a
      command that requests 4 slots if the Determined cluster is
      composed of agents with 2 slots each. The number of slots for
      TensorBoard is fixed at ``0`` and may not be changed.

   -  ``agent_label``: If set, the command/notebook will *only* be
      scheduled on agents that have the given label set. If this is not
      set (the default behavior), the command/notebook will only be
      scheduled on unlabeled agents. An agent's label can be configured
      via the ``label`` field in the :ref:`agent configuration
      <agent-configuration>`.

   -  ``shm_size``: The size in bytes of ``/dev/shm`` for trial
      containers. Defaults to ``4294967296`` (4GiB). If set, this value
      overrides the value specified in the :ref:`master configuration
      <master-configuration>`.

   -  ``priority``: The priority assigned to this experiment. Smaller
      priority assignment indicates higher priority. Only applicable
      when using the ``priority`` scheduler.

-  ``bind_mounts``: Specifies a collection of directories that are
   bind-mounted into the Docker containers for execution. This can be
   used to allow commands to access additional data that is not
   contained in the command context. This field should consist of an
   array of entries. Note that users should ensure that the specified
   host paths are accessible on all agent hosts (e.g., by configuring a
   network file system appropriately). Defaults to an empty list.

   -  ``host_path``: (required) The file system path on each agent to
      use. Must be an absolute filepath.

   -  ``container_path``: (required) The file system path in the
      container to use. May be a relative filepath, in which case it
      will be mounted relative to the working directory inside the
      container. It is not allowed to mount directly into the working
      directory (``container_path == "."``) to reduce the risk of
      cluttering the host filesystem.

   -  ``read_only``: Whether the bind-mount should be a read-only mount.
      Defaults to ``false``.

   -  ``propagation``: (Advanced users only) Optional `propagation
      behavior
      <https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation>`__
      for replicas of the bind-mount. Defaults to ``rprivate``.

-  ``tensorboard_args``: Lists optional arguments for launching
   TensorBoard. Each element of the list should be a string of the form
   ``NAME=VALUE``.
