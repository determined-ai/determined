 Historical Cluster Usage Data
###############################

-  Our goal is to give users insights on how their Determined cluster is
   used. To do so, we provide two features: Web UI visualizations for a
   quick snapshot of usage and API endpoints to download their resource
   allocation data for their own analysis.

-  Resource allocation is measured in the number of GPU hours allocated
   by Determined. This has two important limitations. Importantly, this
   is not resource utilization, so if a user gets 1 GPU allocated but
   only utilizes 20% of the GPU, we would still report one GPU hour.
   Also, this does not include time the GPU is idle (e.g., time waiting
   for a GPU to spin up, or when a GPU is sitting idle and not
   deallocated yet). For that reason GPU hours reported by Determined
   may be less than GPU hours reported by the cloud.

-  Short explanation of the APIs and download CSV button. (Unless all
   the API info is already documented via Swagger?)

-  Our data is aggregated by Determined metadata (e.g., label, user).
   This aggregation is performed nightly, so any data visualized on the
   web UI or downloaded via the endpoint is fresh as of the last night.
   It will not reflect changes to the metadata of a previously run
   experiment (e.g., labels) until the next nightly aggregation.
