 Historical Cluster Usage Data
###############################

Our goal is to give users insights on how their Determined cluster is
used. To do so, we provide two features: Web UI visualizations for a
quick snapshot of usage and API endpoints to download their resource
allocation data for their own analysis.

Resource allocation is measured in the number of GPU hours allocated by
Determined. This has two important limitations. Importantly, this is not
resource utilization, so if a user gets 1 GPU allocated but only
utilizes 20% of the GPU, we would still report one GPU hour. Also, this
does not include time the GPU is idle (e.g., time waiting for a GPU to
spin up, or when a GPU is sitting idle and not deallocated yet). For
that reason GPU hours reported by Determined may be less than GPU hours
reported by the cloud.

Our data is aggregated by Determined metadata (e.g., label, user). This
aggregation is performed nightly, so any data visualized on the web UI
or downloaded via the endpoint is fresh as of the last night. It will
not reflect changes to the metadata of a previously run experiment
(e.g., labels) until the next nightly aggregation.

 Command-line Interface
########################

Historical cluster usage data are accessible through CLI:

-  ``det resources raw <start time> <end time>``: get raw allocation
   information, where the times are full times in the format
   yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ.

-  ``det resources aggregated <start date> <end date>``: get aggregated
   allocation information, where the dates are in the format yyyy-mm-dd.

See :ref:`the CLI reference page <cli>`.
