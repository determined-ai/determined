 Python SDK

You can interact with a Determined cluster using the Python SDK. The Determined Python SDK, a part
of the broader Determined Python library, is designed to perform tasks such as:

-  Creating and organizing experiments
-  Downloading model checkpoints, and adding them to the model registry
-  Retrieving trial metrics

The client module exposes many of the same capabilities as the det CLI tool directly to Python code
with an object-oriented interface.

      Basic Example

      **Find the Top Performing Checkpoint**

      In this example, we'll walk through the most basic workflow for creating an experiment,
      waiting for it to complete, and finding the top-performing checkpoint.

      The first step is to import the client module and possibly to call login():

      .. code:: python

         from determined.experimental import client

         # We will assume that you have called `det user login`, so this is unnecessary:
         # client.login(master=..., user=..., password=...)

      The next step is to call create_experiment():

      .. code:: python

         # Config can be a path to a config file or a Python dict of the config.
         exp = client.create_experiment(config="my_config.yaml", model_dir=".")
         print(f"started experiment {exp.id}")

      The returned object is an ``Experiment`` object, which offers methods to manage the
      experiment's lifecycle. In the following example, we simply await the experiment's completion.

      .. code:: python

         exit_status = exp.wait()
         print(f"experiment completed with status {exit_status}")

      Now that the experiment has completed, you can grab the top-performing checkpoint from
      training:

      .. code:: python

         best_checkpoint = exp.list_checkpoints()[0]
         print(f"best checkpoint was {best_checkpoint.uuid}")

   .. tab::
