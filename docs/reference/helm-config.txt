 Helm Chart Configuration
##########################

When installing :ref:`Determined on Kubernetes <install-on-kubernetes>`
via Helm, the deployment should be configured by editing the
``values.yaml`` and ``Chart.yaml`` files in the :download:`Determined
Helm Chart </helm/determined-0.5.0.tgz>`.

*************************
 ``Chart.yaml`` Settings
*************************

-  ``appVersion``: Configures which version of Determined to install.
   Users can specify a release version (e.g., ``0.13.0``) or specify any
   commit hash from the `upstream Determined repo
   <https://github.com/determined-ai/determined>`_ (e.g.,
   ``b13461ed06f2fad339e179af8028d4575db71a81``). Users are encouraged
   to use a released version.

.. note::

   If using a non-release branch of the Determined repository,
   ``appVersion`` is going to be set to ``X.Y.Z.dev0``. This is not an
   official release version and deploying this version result in a
   ``ImagePullBackOff`` error. Users should remove ``.dev0`` to get the
   latest released version, or they can specify a specific commit hash
   instead.

**************************
 ``values.yaml`` Settings
**************************

-  ``masterPort``: The port at which the Determined master listens for
   connections on. (*Required*)

-  ``useNodePortForMaster``: When set to false (default), a LoadBalancer
   service is deployed to make the Determined master reachable from
   outside the cluster. When set to true, the master will instead be
   exposed behind a NodePort service. When using a NodePort service
   users will typically have to configure an Ingress to make the
   Determined master reachable from outside the cluster. NodePort
   service is recommended when configuring TLS termination in a
   load-balancer.

-  ``tlsSecret``: enables TLS encryption for all communication with the
   Determined master (TLS termination is performed in the Determined
   master). This includes communication between the Determined master
   and the task containers it launches, but does not include
   communication between the task containers (distributed training). The
   specified Secret of type tls must already exist in the same namespace
   in which Determined is being installed.

-  ``db``: Specifies the configuration of the database.

   -  ``name``: The database name to use. (*Required*)

   -  ``user``: The database user to use when logging in the database.
      (*Required*)

   -  ``password``: The password to use when logging in the database.
      (*Required*)

   -  ``port``: The database port to use. (*Required*)

   -  ``hostAddress``: Optional configuration to indicate the address of
      a user provisioned database If configured, the Determined helm
      chart will not deploy a database.

   -  ``storageSize``: Only used when ``hostAddress`` is left blank.
      Configures the size of the PersistentVolumeClaim for the
      Determined deployed database.

   -  ``cpuRequest``: The CPU requirements for the Determined database.

   -  ``memRequest``: The memory requirements for the Determined
      database.

   -  ``useNodePortForDB``: Optional configuration that configures
      whether ClusterIP or NodePort service type is used for the
      Determined database. By default ClusterIP is used.

   -  ``storageClassName``: Optional configuration to indicate
      StorageClass that should be used by the PersistentVolumeClaim for
      the Determined deployed database. This can be left blank if a
      default storage class is specified in the cluster. If dynamic
      provisioning of PersistentVolumes is disabled, users must manually
      create a PersistentVolume that will match the
      PersistentVolumeClaim.

-  ``checkpointStorage``: Specifies where model checkpoints will be
   stored. This can be overridden on a per-experiment basis in the
   :ref:`experiment-configuration`. A checkpoint contains the
   architecture and weights of the model being trained. Determined
   currently supports three kinds of checkpoint storage, ``gcs``,
   ``s3``, and ``shared_fs``, identified by the ``type`` subfield.

   -  ``type: gcs``: Checkpoints are stored on Google Cloud Storage
      (GCS). Authentication is done using GCP's "`Application Default
      Credentials
      <https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/auth.html>`__"
      approach. When using Determined inside Google Kubernetes Engine
      (GCE), the simplest approach is to ensure that the nodes used by
      Determined are running in a service account that has the "Storage
      Object Admin" role on the GCS bucket being used for checkpoints.
      As an alternative (or when running outside of GKE), you can add
      the appropriate `service account credentials
      <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#obtaining_and_providing_service_account_credentials_manually>`__
      to your container (e.g., via a bind-mount), and then set the
      ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable to the
      container path where the credentials are located. See
      :ref:`environment-variables` for more information on how to set
      environment variables in trial environments.

      -  ``bucket``: The GCS bucket name to use.

   -  ``type: s3``: Checkpoints are stored in Amazon S3.

      -  ``bucket``: The S3 bucket name to use.
      -  ``accessKey``: The AWS access key to use.
      -  ``secretKey``: The AWS secret key to use.
      -  ``endpointUrl``: The optional endpoint to use for S3 clones,
         e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080/.

   -  ``type: shared_fs``: Checkpoints are written to a ``hostPath
      Volume``. Users are strongly discouraged from using ``shared_fs``
      for storage beyond initial testing as most Kubernetes cluster
      nodes do not have a shared file system.

      -  ``hostPath``: The file system path on each node to use. This
         directory will be mounted to ``/determined_shared_fs`` inside
         the trial pod.

   -  When an experiment finishes, the system will optionally delete
      some checkpoints to reclaim space. The ``saveExperimentBest``,
      ``saveTrialBest`` and ``saveTrialLatest`` parameters specify which
      checkpoints to save. See :ref:`checkpoint-garbage-collection` for
      more details.

-  ``maxSlotsPerPod``: Specifies number of GPUs there are per machine.
   Determined uses this information when scheduling multi-GPU tasks.
   Each multi-GPU (distributed training) task will be scheduled as a set
   of ``slotsPerTask / maxSlotsPerPod`` separate pods, with each pod
   assigned up to ``maxSlotsPerPod`` GPUs. Distibuted tasks with sizes
   that are not divisible by ``maxSlotsPerPod`` are never scheduled. If
   you have a cluster of different size nodes, set the
   ``maxSlotsPerPod`` to greatest common divisor of all the sizes. For
   example, if you have some nodes with 4 GPUs and other nodes with 8
   GPUs, set ``maxSlotsPerPod`` to ``4`` so that all distributed
   experiments will launch with 4 GPUs per pod (with two pods on 8-GPU
   nodes). (*Required*)

-  ``masterCpuRequest``: The CPU requirements for the Determined master.

-  ``masterMemRequest``: The memory requirements for the Determined
   master.

-  ``taskContainerDefaults``: Specifies Docker defaults for all task
   containers. A task represents a single schedulable unit, such as a
   trial, command, or tensorboard.

   -  ``networkMode``: The Docker network to use for the Determined task
      containers. If this is set to "host", Docker host-mode networking
      will be used instead. Defaults to "bridge".

   -  ``dtrainNetworkInterface``: The network interface to use during
      :ref:`multi-gpu-training`. If not set, Determined automatically
      determines the network interface. When training a model with
      multiple machines, the host network interface used by each machine
      must have the same interface name across machines. This is usually
      determined automatically, but there may be issues if there is an
      interface name common to all machines but it is not routable
      between machines. Determined already filters out common interfaces
      like ``lo`` and ``docker0``, but agent machines may have others.
      If interface detection is not finding the appropriate interface,
      the ``dtrainNetworkInterface`` option can be used to set it
      explicitly (e.g., ``eth11``).

   -  ``ncclPortRange``: The range of ports that nccl is permitted to
      use during distributed training. A valid port range is in the
      format of ``MIN:MAX``.

   -  ``glooPortRange``: The range of ports that gloo is permitted to
      use during distributed training. A valid port range is in the
      format of ``MIN:MAX``.

   -  ``forcePullImage``: Defines the default policy for forcibly
      pulling images from the docker registry and bypassing the docker
      cache. If a pull policy is specified in the :ref:`experiment
      config <exp-environment-image>` this default is overriden. Please
      note that as of November 1st, 2020 unauthenticated users will be
      `capped at 100 pulls from Docker per 6 hours
      <https://www.docker.com/blog/scaling-docker-to-serve-millions-more-developers-network-egress/>`__.
      Defaults to ``false``.

   -  ``cpuPodSpec``: Sets the default pod spec for all non-gpu tasks.
      See :ref:`custom-pod-specs` for details.

   -  ``gpuPodSpec``: Sets the default pod spec for all ngpu tasks. See
      :ref:`custom-pod-specs` for details.

   -  ``cpuImage``: Sets the default docker image for all non-gpu tasks.
      If a docker image is specified in the :ref:`experiment config
      <exp-environment-image>` this default is overriden. Defaults to:
      ``determinedai/environments:py-3.7-pytorch-1.7-tf-1.15-cpu-0.12.0``.

   -  ``gpuImage``: Sets the default docker image for all gpu tasks. If
      a docker image is specified in the :ref:`experiment config
      <exp-environment-image>` this default is overriden. Defaults to:
      ``determinedai/environments:cuda-10.2-pytorch-1.7-tf-1.15-gpu-0.12.0``.

-  ``enterpriseEdition``: Specifies whether to use Determined enterprise
   edition.

-  ``imagePullSecretName``: Specifies the image pull secret for pulling
   the Determined master image. Required when using the enterprise
   edition.

-  ``telemetry``: Specifies whether we collect anonymous information
   about the usage of Determined.

   -  ``enabled``: Whether collection is enabled. Defaults to ``true``.

-  ``defaultPassword``: Specifies a string containing the default
   password for the admin and determined user accounts.

-  ``logging``: Configures where trial logs are stored. This section
   takes the same shape as the logging configuration in the
   :ref:`cluster configuration <cluster-configuration>`, except that
   names are changed to camel case to match Helm conventions (e.g.,
   ``skip_verify`` would be ``skipVerify`` here).

   -  ``logging.security.tls.certificate``: Contains the contents of an
      expected TLS certificate for the Elasticsearch cluster, rather
      than a path as it does in the cluster configuration. This can be
      conveniently set at the command line using ``helm install
      --set-file logging.security.tls.certificate=<path>``.

-  ``defaultScheduler``: Configures the default scheduler that
   Determined will use. Currently supports the ``coscheduler`` option,
   which enables the `lightweight coscheduling plugin
   <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/tree/release-1.18/pkg/coscheduling>`__,
   and the ``preemption`` option, which enables a priority-based
   preemption scheduler. Unless specified as ``coscheduler``, Determined
   will use the default Kubernetes scheduler.
