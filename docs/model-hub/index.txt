.. rubric:: **Overview**

Determined's **model-hub** library makes it easy to train models from
popular third-party libraries with a Determined cluster. With
**model-hub**, use trusted implementations of model architectures with
Determined's ability to easily scale to distributed training, track
experiments, share resources, and perform hyperparameter searches.

Each supported third-party library in **model-hub** is accompanied by:

-  Official examples checked for correctness and thoroughly tested for
   use with Determined.
-  A base Determined Trial class with common functionality implemented
   for the user.
-  A prebuilt docker environment with all dependencies installed and
   versioned for reproducibility.
-  A suite of helper functions (if applicable) to allow users to easily
   write their own Trial classes for use with the third-party library.

.. rubric:: **Getting Started**

For a given task, deep learning practitioners often adapt existing model
implementations from a trusted third-party library, such as HuggingFace
Transformers. When beginning your deep learning project in this way, we
suggest using **model-hub** with the following steps:

-  Check for a Model Hub library that supports model implementations for
   your task.
-  If the Model Hub Library includes an official example fit for your
   task, copy, customize, and deploy it.
-  If the Model Hub Library does not include example fit for your task,
   copy the base Determined Trial class and customize it.

For detailed instructions, check out the documentation for your Model
Hub library of choice.

Future libraries on our roadmap

-  `mmdetection <https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection>`_
-  `detectron2 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2>`_

Our initial release of **model-hub** includes support for the
`Huggingface transformers library
<https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_. We are actively working
on releasing new third-party libraries. Please check back for updates.
If you have additional libraries you want to see supported in
**model-hub** please let us know by filing an issue on `GitHub
<https://github.com/determined-ai/determined>`_ or reaching out on our
community `Slack.
