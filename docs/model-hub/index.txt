.. rubric:: **Overview**

Determined's **model-hub** library makes it easy to train models from popular third-party libraries
with a Determined cluster. With **model-hub**, use trusted implementations of model architectures
with Determined's ability to easily scale to distributed training, track experiments, share
resources, and perform hyperparameter searches.

Each supported third-party library in **model-hub** is accompanied by:

-  Official examples checked for correctness and thoroughly tested for use with Determined.
-  A base Determined Trial class with common functionality implemented for the user.
-  A prebuilt docker environment with all dependencies installed and versioned for reproducibility.
-  A suite of helper functions (if applicable) to allow users to easily write their own Trial
   classes for use with the third-party library.

.. rubric:: **Getting Started**

For a given task, deep learning practitioners often adapt existing model implementations from a
trusted third-party library, such as HuggingFace Transformers. When beginning your deep learning
project in this way, we suggest using **model-hub** with the following steps:

-  Check for a Model Hub library that supports model implementations for your task.
-  If the Model Hub Library includes an official example fit for your task, copy, customize, and
   deploy it.
-  If the Model Hub Library does not include example fit for your task, copy the base Determined
   Trial class and customize it.

For detailed instructions, check out the documentation for your Model Hub library of choice.

Our initial release of **model-hub** includes support for the `Huggingface transformers library
<https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_. We are actively working on releasing new
third-party libraries. Please check back for updates. If you have additional libraries you want to
see supported in **model-hub** please let us know by filing an issue on `GitHub
<https://github.com/determined-ai/determined>`_ or reaching out on our community `Slack.
