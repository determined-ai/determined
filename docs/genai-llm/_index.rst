 How to Use JupyterLab to Test, Evaluate and Finetune LLMs
###########################################################

Building an LLM application is a process of trials and errors. LLM application developers need to iteratively select the best base model, improve the prompts, and finetune the model with more data to make the LLM output aligned with what is desired.

With Generative AI Studio's Python library that provides functions of testing, evaluation, and finetuning LLMs, you can use a few lines of code to find the best LLM base model and prompt combinations or customize LLMs for their proprietary data. Accessing Lore’s Python library in a JupyterLab allows you to develop on LLMs iteratively and efficiently without being a LLM expert.

In this tutorial, we’ll use Python APIs to perform the following in a JupyterLab instance:

-  Test an LLM
-  Evaluate the LLM
-  Finetune the LLM
