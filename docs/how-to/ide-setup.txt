 IDE Setup (PyCharm)
#####################

Model developers may develop and debug models with their preferred IDE.
In this guide, we show how to configure `PyCharm
<https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__ in order to develop and debug
experiments submitted from Python, i.e. :ref:`this
pattern <model-definitions_trial-api-create>` for the Trial API.

***************
 Prerequisites
***************

This guide assumes that you have created a `virtualenv
<https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ or `Conda
<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__ environment in which you have
installed the dependencies required for local development. For example,
to create a Python 3.7 virtualenv:

.. code::

   python3.7 -m venv /path/to/env/
   source /path/to/env/bin/activate

You will then want to install the ``determined`` Python package, as well
the TensorFlow or PyTorch library versions that your code will run
against when submitting to the cluster. For example, if you are using
Determined's `default task container image
<https://github.com/determined-ai/environments/blob/master/Makefile>`__
for a PyTorch model, you would install the following dependencies in
your virtualenv:

.. code::

   pip install determined==<Determined version>
   pip install torch==<Determined's default image PyTorch version, e.g., 1.4.0>
   pip install torchvision==<Determined's default image torchvision version, e.g., 0.5.0>

If you are using a :ref:`custom Docker image <custom-docker-images>` for
running task containers, you must also install the same dependencies in
your local development environment.
