Using Trained Checkpoints
=========================

Determined provides APIs for downloading trained checkpoints and loading them
into memory in a python process.

The following guide will discuss:

#. Querying trained model checkpoints from trials and experiments.
#. Loading models into memory in a python process.
#. Using the Determined CLI to download checkpoints to disk.

Querying Checkpoints
--------------------

The :class:`ExperimentReference <determined.experimental.ExperimentReference>`
class is a reference to an experiment. It is retrieved via the
:class:`Determined <determined.experimental.Determined>` class. The reference
contains the ``top_checkpoint`` method. Without arguments, the method will
check the experiment configuration searcher field for the ``metric`` and
``smaller_is_better`` values. These values are used to sort the experiment's
checkpoints by validation performance. The searcher settings in the following
snippet from an experiment configuration file will result in checkpoints being
sorted by the loss metric in ascending order.

.. code:: yaml

   searcher:
     metric: "loss"
     smaller_is_better: true

The following snippet can be run with a python interpreter after the
specified experiment has generated a checkpoint. It returns an
instance of :class:`Checkpoint <determined.experimental.Checkpoint>`
representing the checkpoint from an experiment with the best validation metric.

.. code:: python

  from determined.experimental import Determined

  checkpoint = Determined().get_experiment(id).top_checkpoint()

Checkpoints can be sorted by any metric, by using ``sort_by``, which states
which metric to use, and ``smaller_is_better``, which defines whether to sort
the checkpoints in ascending or descending order with respect to the
``sort_by`` metric.

.. code:: python

  from determined.experimental import Determined

  checkpoint = Determined().get_experiment(id).top_checkpoint(sort_by="accuracy", smaller_is_better=False)

You may also query the top N checkpoints to receive a sorted list of
checkpoints using the ``top_n_checkpoints`` method. This method also accepts
``sort_by`` and ``smaller_is_better`` arguments.

The following snippet returns the top 5 checkpoints for a specified experiment.

.. code:: python

  from determined.experimental import Determined

  checkpoints = Determined.get_experiment(id).top_n_checkpoints(5)


The :class:`TrialReference <determined.experimental.TrialReference>` is used
for fine grained control over checkpoint selection. It contains a
``top_checkpoint`` method which mirrors the above ``top_checkpoint`` for an
experiment. It also contains ``select_checkpoint`` which offers 3 ways to query
checkpoints.

#. ``best``: returns the best checkpoint based on validation metrics as discussed above. When using ``best``, ``smaller_is_better`` and ``sort_by`` are also accepted.
#. ``latest``: returns the most recent checkpoint for the trial.
#. ``uuid``: returns the checkpoint for the trial that matches the specified uuid.


The following snippet showcases how to use the different modes for selecting
checkpoints.

.. code:: python

  from determined.experimental import Determined

  trial = Determined.get_trial(id)

  best_checkpoint = trial.top_checkpoint()

  most_accurate_checkpoint = trial.select_checkpoint(
    best=True,
    sort_by="accuracy",
    smaller_is_better=False
  )

  most_recent_checkpoint = trial.select_checkpoint(latest=True)

  specific_checkpoint = trial.select_checkpoint(uuid="uuid-for-checkpoint")

Using the Checkpoint class
--------------------------
The :class:`Checkpoint <determined.experimental.Checkpoint>` class can both
download the checkpoint from persistent storage and load it into memory in a
python process.

The following snippet downloads a checkpoint from persistent storage to the
local file system. By default, the method downloads the checkpoint to
`./checkpoints/<checkpoint-uuid>`. The method accepts ``path`` as a parameter
which changes the checkpoint download location.

.. code:: python

  from determined.experimental import Determined

  checkpoint = Determined().get_experiment(id).top_checkpoint()
  checkpoint_path = checkpoint.download()

  specific_path = checkpoint.download(path="specific-checkpoint-path")

The ``load`` method of the :class:`Checkpoint
<determined.experimental.Checkpoint>` class downloads the checkpoint, if it
does not exist locally, and then loads it into memory in a python
process, as shown in the following snippet.

.. code:: python

  from determined.experimental import Determined

  checkpoint = Determined.get_experiment(id).top_checkpoint()
  model = checkpoint.load()

Tensorflow checkpoints are saved in the ``saved_model`` format and are loaded
as trackable objects (see documentation for `tf.compat.v1.saved_model.load_v2
<https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/load_v2>`_
for details).

PyTorch checkpoints are saved via pickle and loaded as ``nn.Module``
(see `pytorch serialization <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/serialization.html>`_ for details).

Download Checkpoints via the CLI
--------------------------------
Determined offers a CLI command, ``det trial download`` for downloading checkpoints locally.
Similar to the :class:`TrialReference <determined.experimental.TrialReference>`
above, the command accepts ``--best``, ``--latest``, and ``--uuid`` options.

.. code::

  # download best checkpoint
  det trial download <trial_id> --best

The command should display the following upon successfully downloading the
checkpoint.
::

  Local checkpoint path:
  checkpoints/46985143-af68-4d48-ab91-a6447052ca49

       Batch | Checkpoint UUID                      | Validation Metrics
  -----------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------
        1000 | 46985143-af68-4d48-ab91-a6447052ca49 | {
             |                                      |     "num_inputs": 0,
             |                                      |     "validation_metrics": {
             |                                      |         "loss": 7.906739711761475,
             |                                      |         "accuracy": 0.9646000266075134,
             |                                      |         "global_step": 1000,
             |                                      |         "average_loss": 0.12492649257183075
             |                                      |     }
             |                                      | }


The ``--latest`` and ``--uuid`` options are used as follows:

.. code:: bash

  # download the most recent checkpoint
  det trial download <trial_id> --latest

  # download a specific checkpoint
  det trial download <trial_id> --uuid <uuid-for-checkpoint>


Loading from a Local Path
-------------------------
:class:`Checkpoint <determined.experimental.Checkpoint>` contains a static method,
``load_from_path``, for loading a checkpoint from a local path.

.. code:: bash

  det trial download --best --output-dir local_checkpoint

In python, the checkpoint is loaded via:

.. code:: python

  from determined.experimental import Checkpoint

  model = Checkpoint.load_from_path("local_checkpoint")
