Getting Started with Determined REST APIs
=========================================

We use `protobuf <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers>`_ to define
language agnostic message structures. We use these type defintions with
`gRPC-gateway <https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/>`_ to provide
consistent REST endpoints to serve various needs.

Using these two tools we also auto generate OpenAPI v2 spec (ka Swagger RESTful API Documentation Specification) which let's us inline documentation for each endpoint
and response in our codebase.

Having this specification prepared we can serve it to different tools to generate
code for different lanugages (eg swagger codegen) as well as provide web based explorers into our APIs (eg Swagger UI).

Swagger UI
----------

As Swagger puts it:

Swagger UI allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.



Reach the Swagger UI for your Determined installation by click API icon from the
Determined WebUI or by visiting the path `/swagger-ui` on your Determined cluster.

Authentication
--------------

Most of the API calls to Determined cluster needs to be authenticated.
On each API call the server expects a Bearer token to be present.

To receive a token POST a valid username and password combination to the login
endpoint, currently at `/api/v1/auth/login` with the following format:

.. code:: json

  {
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string"
  }

Example:

.. code:: bash

  curl -s "${host}/login?cookie=true" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-binary '{"username":"john","password":"2k34h5@$"}' \

Sample Response: 

.. code:: json

  {
    "token": "string",
    "user": {
      "username": "string",
      "admin": true,
      "active": true,
      "agent_user_group": {
        "agent_uid": 0,
        "agent_gid": 0
      }
    }
  }

Now store and attach the provided token to your future API calls under
`Authorization` header and with the following format: `Bearer $TOKEN`.


Example:

.. code:: bash

  # using a bearer token
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" "${@}"

  # or (not recommended) through a cookie value
  curl -H "Cookie: auth=${token}" "${@}"
