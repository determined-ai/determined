################################
 Using The Determined REST APIs
################################

Determined's REST APIs provide a way for users and external tools to
interact with a Determined cluster programmatically. Determined includes
detailed documentation about all of the REST endpoints provided by the
API, alongside a playground for interacting with the API. The endpoint
documentation and playground are provided via `Swagger UI
<https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/>`__ and are available `here
<../rest-api/index.html>`__.

****************
 Authentication
****************

Most of the API calls to Determined cluster need to be authenticated. On
each API call, the server expects a Bearer token to be present.

To receive a token POST a valid username and password combination to the
login endpoint, currently at `/api/v1/auth/login` with the following
format:

.. code:: json

   {
     "username": "string",
     "password": "string"
   }

Sample request:

.. code:: bash

   curl -s "${DET_MASTER}/api/v1/auth/login" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-binary '{"username":"determined","password":""}'

Sample response:

.. code:: json

   {
     "token": "string",
     "user": {
       "username": "string",
       "admin": true,
       "active": true,
       "agent_user_group": {
         "agent_uid": 0,
         "agent_gid": 0
       }
     }
   }

Once we have the token we can store and attach to our future API calls
under `Authorization` header and with the following format: `Bearer
$TOKEN`.

*********
 Example
*********

In this example, we will show how to use the REST APIs to unarchive an
experiment that was previously archived.

By looking at the archive endpoint entry from our API docs (Swagger UI),
we see that all we need is an experiment ID.

To find our an experiment that was archived, we lookup the experiments
endpoint on our to figure out which filtering options we have. We see
that we have ``archived`` and ``limit`` to work with. Using a bearer
token we authenticate our request. We then use the ``archived`` and
``limit`` query parameters to limit the result set to only show a single
archived experiment.

.. code:: bash

   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" "${DET_MASTER}/api/v1/experiments?archived=true&limit=1"

Here's what our example response looks like. We see it matches the
expected response shape.

.. code:: json

   {
     "experiments": [
       {
         "id": 16,
         "description": "mnist_pytorch_const",
         "labels": [],
         "startTime": "2020-08-26T20:12:35.337160Z",
         "endTime": "2020-08-26T20:12:51.951720Z",
         "state": "STATE_COMPLETED",
         "archived": true,
         "numTrials": 1,
         "progress": 0,
         "username": "determined"
       }
     ],
     "pagination": {
       "offset": 0,
       "limit": 1,
       "startIndex": 0,
       "endIndex": 1,
       "total": 1
     }
   }

Now that we have our desired experiment's ID, we use it to target the
experiment through the unarchive endpoint using a POST request as
specified by the endpoint:

.. code:: bash

   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" -X POST "${DET_MASTER}/api/v1/experiments/16/unarchive"
