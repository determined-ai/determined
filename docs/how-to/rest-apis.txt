 Using The Determined REST APIs
################################

Determined's REST APIs provide a way for users and external tools to
interact with a Determined cluster programmatically. Determined includes
detailed documentation about all of the REST endpoints provided by the
API, alongside a playground for interacting with the API. The endpoint
documentation and playground are provided via `Swagger UI
<https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/>`__.

************
 Swagger UI
************

As Swagger puts it:

   "Swagger UI allows anyone — be it your development team or your end
   consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources
   without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s
   automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger)
   Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back
   end implementation and client-side consumption."


A static version of the Swagger UI is bundled with these docs
`here
<../api/index.html>`__. If
you have access to a running Determined cluster you can checkout the
live-interact version by clicking the API icon from the Determined WebUI or
by visiting the path `/docs/api/` on your Determined cluster.

The Swagger UI gives you an up-to-date view of the APIs your Determined
cluster provides in a readable and interactive fashion.

On this page, you'll see a list of all the available endpoints grouped
by their workflows. If you click on each endpoint you'll be presented
with expected inputs and outputs for it as well as an interactive tool
that lets you try out the endpoint. Note that for the interactive
portion to work, you'd need to have the appropriate cookie set and have
a running cluster. To set up the authentication take a look at the
authentication section below or simply log in through the WebUI.

****************
 Authentication
****************

Most of the API calls to Determined cluster need to be authenticated. On
each API call, the server expects a Bearer token to be present.

To receive a token POST a valid username and password combination to the
login endpoint, currently at `/api/v1/auth/login` with the following
format:

.. code:: json

   {
     "username": "string",
     "password": "string"
   }

Sample request:

.. code:: bash

   curl -s "${DET_MASTER}/api/v1/auth/login" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-binary '{"username":"determined","password":""}'

Sample response:

.. code:: json

   {
     "token": "string",
     "user": {
       "username": "string",
       "admin": true,
       "active": true,
       "agent_user_group": {
         "agent_uid": 0,
         "agent_gid": 0
       }
     }
   }

Once we have the token we can store and attach to our future API calls
under `Authorization` header and with the following format: `Bearer
$TOKEN`.

*********
 Example
*********

In this example, we will show how to use the REST APIs to unarchive an
experiment that was previously archived.

By looking at the archive endpoint entry from our API docs (Swagger UI),
we see that all we need is an experiment ID.

To find our an experiment that was archived, we lookup the experiments
endpoint on our to figure out which filtering options we have. We see
that we have ``archived`` and ``limit`` to work with. Using a bearer
token we authenticate our request. We then use the ``archived`` and
``limit`` query parameters to limit the result set to only show a single
archived experiment.

.. code:: bash

   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" "${DET_MASTER}/api/v1/experiments?archived=true&limit=1"

Here's what our example response looks like. We see it matches the
expected response shape.

.. code:: json

   {
     "experiments": [
       {
         "id": 16,
         "description": "mnist_pytorch_const",
         "labels": [],
         "startTime": "2020-08-26T20:12:35.337160Z",
         "endTime": "2020-08-26T20:12:51.951720Z",
         "state": "STATE_COMPLETED",
         "archived": true,
         "numTrials": 1,
         "progress": 0,
         "username": "determined"
       }
     ],
     "pagination": {
       "offset": 0,
       "limit": 1,
       "startIndex": 0,
       "endIndex": 1,
       "total": 1
     }
   }

Now that we have our desired experiment's ID, we use it to target the
experiment through the unarchive endpoint using a POST request as
specified by the endpoint:

.. code:: bash

   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" -X POST "${DET_MASTER}/api/v1/experiments/16/unarchive"

************************
 How Our REST APIs work
************************

We use `protobuf <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers>`_ to
define language-agnostic message structures. We use these type
definitions with `gRPC-gateway
<https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/>`_ to provide consistent
REST endpoints to serve various needs.

Using these two tools we also auto-generate OpenAPI v2 spec (aka Swagger
RESTful API Documentation Specification) which lets us inline
documentation for each endpoint and response in our codebase.

Having this specification prepared we can serve it to different tools to
generate code for different languages (eg swagger codegen) as well as
provide web-based explorers into our APIs (e.g., Swagger UI).
