Install Determined Using det-deploy
=======================================

This document shows how to deploy Determined locally or in a production
cluster using the ``det-deploy`` command-line tool, which automates the
process of starting Determined as a collection of Docker containers.

In a typical production setup, the master and agents will run on
separate machines. They can also run on a single machine, which is
especially useful for local development. This guide provides
instructions for both scenarios.

Preliminary Setup
-----------------

Install ``det-deploy`` by running

.. code::

   pip install determined-deploy

Configuring and Starting the Cluster
------------------------------------

A configuration file is needed to set important values in the master,
such as where to save model checkpoints. For information about how to
create a configuration file, see :ref:`cluster-configuration`. The
configuration file must be named ``master.yaml`` (but it can be in any
directory).

.. note::

   ``det-deploy`` transparently manages PostgreSQL and Hasura along with
   the master, so the configuration options related to those services do
   not need to be set.

Deploying the Master
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the machine where you wish to run the master, run

.. code::

   det-deploy local fixture-up --etc-root <directory containing master.yaml>

This will start the master, listening on port 8080. To verify that the
master is running, navigate to ``http://<master-hostname>:8080`` in a
browser, which should bring up the Determined WebUI. If you're using
your local machine, for example, navigate to ``http://localhost:8080``.

You can also deploy one or more agents on the same machine as the master
by adding ``--agents <number>`` to the command line. For example:

.. code::

   det-deploy local fixture-up --etc-root <directory containing master.yaml> --agents 4

In the WebUI, navigate to the ``Cluster`` page, where you should now see
slots available (either CPU or GPU, depending on what hardware is
available on the machine).

Deploying Agents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploying an agent by itself can also be done with a single
``det-deploy`` command. On the machine where you wish to run an agent,
run:

..
   NOTE: `agent-up` and `agent-down` are still in review (#4929).

.. code::

   det-deploy local agent-up <master_hostname>

This will create an agent on that machine. To verify whether it has
successfully connected to the master, navigate to the WebUI and check
whether slots have appeared on the ``Cluster`` page.

.. note::

   The hostname used must be reachable from within Docker containers
   running on the agent machine. In particular, ``localhost`` will
   usually not work, even if the master and agent are running on the
   same machine. Use the ``--agents`` option in that case instead.

Managing the Cluster
--------------------

``det-deploy`` automatically configures the containers it creates so
that Docker will handle keeping them running across machine restarts.

To stop the master, PostgreSQL, and Hasura, run

.. code::

   det-deploy local fixture-down

on the machine that is running the master. If you deployed any agents
with ``fixture-up``, this will also stop those agents.

To stop an agent, run

.. code::

   det-deploy local agent-down

on the machine that is running the agent.
