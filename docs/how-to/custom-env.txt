###########################
 Environment Configuration
###########################

Determined launches workloads using Docker containers. The container
configuration is referred to as the **environment**.

There are three methods to customize the environment that workloads
execute in:

#. Environment variables
#. Startup hooks (``startup-hook.sh``)
#. Custom Docker images

.. _environment-variables:

***********************
 Environment Variables
***********************

For both trial runners and commands, Determined allows users to
configure the environment variables inside the container through the
``environment.environment_variables`` configuration field of the
:ref:`experiment <experiment-configuration>` or :ref:`task
<command-notebook-configuration>` config. The format is a list of
strings in the format ``NAME=VALUE``:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     environment_variables:
       - A=hello world
       - B=$A
       - C=${B}
       # `A`, `B`, and `C` will each have the value `hello_world` in the container.

Variables are set sequentially, which affect variables that depend on
the expansion of other variables.

Proxy variables set in this way will take precedent over those set using
the :ref:`agent configuration <agent-configuration>`.

.. _startup-hooks:

***************
 Startup Hooks
***************

If a file named ``startup-hook.sh`` exists at the top level of your
model definition directory, Determined will automatically execute this
file during the startup of every Docker container. This occurs before
any Python interpreters are launched or any deep learning operations are
performed; this allows the startup hook to customize the container
environment, install additional dependencies, download data sets, or do
practically anything else that you can do in a shell script.

.. note::

   Startup hooks are not cached and run before the start of every
   workload. Hence, performing expensive or long-running operations in a
   startup hook can result in poor performance.

Here is an example of a startup hook that installs the ``wget`` utility
and the Python package ``pandas``:

.. code:: bash

   apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget
   python3 -m pip install pandas

The :download:`Iris example </examples/iris_tf_keras.tgz>` contains a
TensorFlow Keras model that uses a startup hook to install an additional
Python dependency.

.. _container-images:

******************
 Container Images
******************

Determined provides a set of officially supported Docker images. These
are the default images used to launch containers for experiments,
commands, and any other workflow in the Determined system.

.. _default-environment:

Default Images
==============

In the current version of Determined, experiments and tasks are executed
in containers with the following:

-  Ubuntu 18.04
-  CUDA 10.2
-  Python 3.7
-  TensorFlow 1.15.5
-  PyTorch 1.7.1

Determined will automatically select GPU-specific versions of each
library when running on agents with GPUs.

In addition to the above settings, all trial runner containers are
launched with additional Determined-specific harness code that
orchestrates model training and evaluation in the container. Trial
runner containers are also loaded with the experiment's model definition
and values of the hyperparameters for the current trial.

.. note::

   The default images are
   ``determinedai/environments:cuda-10.2-pytorch-1.7-tf-1.15-gpu-0.12.0``
   and
   ``determinedai/environments:py-3.7-pytorch-1.7-tf-1.15-cpu-0.12.0``
   for GPU and CPU respectively.

.. _cuda-11-images:

CUDA 11 Images
==============

Determined also supports running CUDA 11-enabled versions of the
frameworks, and has a Docker image you can use for experiments and tasks
containing the following:

-  Ubuntu 18.04
-  CUDA 11.0
-  Python 3.7
-  TensorFlow 2.4.1
-  PyTorch 1.7.1
-  PyTorch Lightning 1.2

This can be configured in your experiment configuration like below:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     image: "determinedai/environments:cuda-11.0-pytorch-1.7-lightning-1.2-tf-2.4-gpu-0.12.0"

Older Images
============

Images that provide older versions of the frameworks are still available
and supported. Note that the performance of some models can vary with
different CUDA versions.

-  determinedai/environments:py-3.6.9-pytorch-1.4-tf-1.15-cpu-067db2b
-  determinedai/environments:py-3.6.9-pytorch-1.4-tf-2.2-cpu-067db2b
-  determinedai/environments:cuda-10.0-pytorch-1.4-tf-1.15-gpu-067db2b
-  determinedai/environments:cuda-10.1-pytorch-1.4-tf-2.2-gpu-067db2b

.. _custom-docker-images:

Custom Images
=============

While the official images contain all the dependencies needed for basic
deep learning workloads, many workloads have extra dependencies. If
those extra dependencies are quick to install, you may want to consider
using a :ref:`startup hook <startup-hooks>`. For situations where
installing dependencies via ``startup-hook.sh`` would take too long, we
suggest building your own Docker image and publishing to a Docker
registry like `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`__.

.. warning::

   It is important to not install the TensorFlow, PyTorch, Horovod, or
   Apex packages as doing so will conflict with the base packages that
   are installed into Determined's official environments.

We recommend that custom images use one of the official Determined
images as a base image (using the ``FROM`` instruction). Here is an
example of a Dockerfile that installs custom ``conda``-, ``pip``- and
``apt``-based dependencies.

.. code:: bash

   # Determined Image
   FROM determinedai/environments:cuda-10.2-pytorch-1.7-tf-1.15-gpu-0.12.0

   # Custom Configuration
   RUN apt-get update && \
      DEBIAN_FRONTEND="noninteractive" apt-get -y install tzdata && \
      apt-get install -y unzip python-opencv graphviz
   COPY environment.yml /tmp/environment.yml
   COPY pip_requirements.txt /tmp/pip_requirements.txt
   RUN conda env update --name base --file /tmp/environment.yaml
   RUN conda clean --all --force-pkgs-dirs --yes
   RUN eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)" && \
      conda activate base && \
      pip install --requirement /tmp/pip_requirements.txt

Assuming this image has been published to a public repository on Docker
Hub, you can configure an experiment, command, or notebook to use the
image as follows:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     image: "my-user-name/my-repo-name:my-tag"

where ``my-user-name`` is your Docker Hub user, ``my-repo-name`` is the
name of the Docker Hub repository, and ``my-tag`` is the image tag to
use (e.g., ``latest``).

If your image has been published to a private Docker Hub repository, you
can also specify the credentials to use to access the repository:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     image: "my-user-name/my-repo-name:my-tag"
     registry_auth:
       username: my-user-name
       password: my-password

If your image has been published to a private `Docker Registry
<https://docs.docker.com/registry/>`__, specify the registry path as
part of the ``image`` field:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     image: "myregistry.local:5000/my-user-name/my-repo-name:my-tag"

Images will be fetched via HTTPS by default. An HTTPS proxy can be
configured using the ``https_proxy`` field as part of the :ref:`agent
configuration <agent-configuration>`.

Your custom image and credentials can also be set as the defaults for
all tasks launched in Determined. This can be done under ``image`` and
``registry_auth`` in the :ref:`master-configuration`. Please note that
for this to take effect you will have to restart the master.
