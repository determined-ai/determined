Environment Configuration
=========================

Determined launches trials of experiments and commands in Docker containers.
The container configuration is referred to as the **environment**.

There are two methods of customizing this environment without explicitly
specifying a Docker image: environment variables and ``startup-hook.sh``.

.. _environment-variables:

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For both trial runners and commands, Determined allows users to configure the
environment variables inside the container through the
``environment.environment_variables`` configuration field of the
experiment config. The format is a list of strings in the format
``NAME=VALUE``:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     environment_variables:
       - A=hello world
       - B=$A
       - C=${B}
       # `A`, `B`, and `C` will each have the value `hello_world` in the container.

Variables are set sequentially, which affect variables that depend
on expansion of other variables.

``startup-hook.sh``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``startup-hook.sh`` is a script that is called during startup of your
Docker container. You can use this script to ``pip install`` packages, ``apt
install`` packages, or practically anything else that you can do with bash.
This script should be placed in the base directory of your model definition,
(e.g. ``super-deep-model/startup-hook.sh`` if the base directory is
``super-deep-model/``). An example startup script that installs the command
line utility ``wget`` and the Python package ``pandas`` is below.

.. code:: bash

   apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget
   python3.6 -m pip install pandas


Official Docker Images in Determined
------------------------------------

Determined has a set of officially supported Docker images used to launch
Docker containers for experiments, commands, and any other workflow in the
Determined system.

.. _default-environment:

Default Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the current version of Determined, the experiments and commands are executed
in containers with the following:

-  Ubuntu 18.04
-  CUDA 10.0
-  Python 3.6.9
-  TensorFlow 1.14.0
-  PyTorch 1.4.0

Determined will automatically select GPU-specific versions of each library
when running on agents with GPUs.

In addition to the above settings, all trial runner containers are
launched with additional Determined-specific harness code that orchestrates
model training and evaluation in the container. Trial runner containers
are also loaded with the experiment's model definition and values of the
hyperparameters for the current trial.


.. note::

   The default images are
   ``determinedai/environments:cuda-10.0-pytorch-1.4-tf-1.14-gpu-0.4.0`` and
   ``determinedai/environments:py-3.6.9-pytorch-1.4-tf-1.14-cpu-0.4.0`` for GPU
   and CPU respectively.

TF2 Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Determined also supports TensorFlow 2.1 and has a Docker image you can use for
experiments and commands containing the following:

-  Ubuntu 18.04
-  CUDA 10.0
-  Python 3.6.9
-  TensorFlow 2.1.0
-  PyTorch 1.4.0

This can be configured in your experiment configuration like below:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     image:
       gpu: "determinedai/environments:cuda-10.1-pytorch-1.4-tf-2.2-gpu-0.4.0"
       cpu: "determinedai/environments:py-3.6.9-pytorch-1.4-tf-2.2-cpu-0.4.0"


Custom Docker Images in Determined
----------------------------------

While our official images contain all the dependencies needed for basic
workloads, many workloads have extra dependencies. If those extra dependencies
are quick to install, you may want to consider using ``startup-hook.sh``.
For situations where installing dependencies via ``startup-hook.sh``
would take too long, we suggest building your own Docker image and
publishing to a Docker registry like `Docker Hub
<https://hub.docker.com/>`__. Below you will find an example of a
Dockerfile. For more information on building and publishing Docker
images to Docker Hub, consider following
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/.

The example Dockerfile below installs ``conda`` and ``pip`` dependencies based
on their respective dependency file format.

.. warning::

   It is important to not install the TensorFlow, PyTorch, Horovod, or Apex
   packages as this will conflict with the base packages that are installed into
   Determined's official environments.

.. code:: docker

  FROM determinedai/environments:cuda-10.0-pytorch-1.4-tf-1.14-gpu-0.4.0
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y unzip python-opencv graphviz
  COPY environment.yml /tmp/environment.yml
  COPY pip_requirements.txt /tmp/pip_requirements.txt
  RUN conda env update --name base --file /tmp/environment.yml && \
      conda clean --all --force-pkgs-dirs --yes
  RUN eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)" && \
      conda activate base && \
      pip install --requirement /tmp/pip_requirements.txt


Assuming this image is published as ``det-custom-registry:det-custom-tag`` then
you can configure the environment like:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     image: "det-custom-registry:det-custom-tag"
