 Notebooks
###########

`Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`__ are a convenient way to
develop and debug machine learning models, visualize the behavior of
trained models, or even manage the training lifecycle of a model
manually. Determined makes it easy to launch and manage notebooks.

Determined will schedule a Jupyter notebook in a containerized
environment on the cluster and proxy HTTP requests to and from the
notebook container through the Determined master. The lifecycle
management of Jupyter notebooks in Determined is left up to the
user---once a Jupyter notebook has been scheduled onto the cluster, it
will remain scheduled indefinitely until the user explicitly shuts down
the notebook. Once a notebook has been terminated, it is not possible to
reactivate it. However, *new* notebooks can easily be configured to
restore the state of a previous notebook---see :ref:`notebook-state` for
more information.

************************
 Working with Notebooks
************************

There are two ways to access notebooks in Determined: the command-line
interface (CLI) and the WebUI. To install the CLI, see
:ref:`install-cli`.

Command Line
============

The following command will automatically start a notebook with a single
GPU and open it in your browser.

.. code:: bash

   det notebook start

The ``--context`` option adds a folder or file to the notebook
environment, allowing its contents to be accessed from within the
notebook.

.. code:: bash

   det notebook start --context folder/file

The ``--config-file`` option can be used to create a notebook with an
environment specified by a configuration file.

.. code:: bash

   det notebook start --config-file config.yaml

For more information on how to write the notebook configuration file,
see :ref:`notebook-configuration`.

.. warning::

   In Determined, notebook state is not persistent by default. If a
   failure occurs (e.g., the agent hosting the notebook crashes), the
   content of the notebook will not be saved. To ensure that notebook
   state is persisted, refer to :ref:`notebook-state` for more
   information.

Other Useful Commands
---------------------

A full list of notebook commands can be found by running:

.. code:: bash

   det notebook --help

To view all running notebooks:

.. code:: bash

   det notebook list

To kill a notebook, you need its ID, which can be found using the list
command.

.. code:: bash

   det notebook kill <id>

WebUI
=====

Notebooks can also be started from the WebUI. You can click the "Tasks"
tab to take you to a list of the tasks currently running on the cluster.

|

From here, you can find running notebooks. You can reopen, kill, or view
logs for each notebook.

To create a new notebook, click "Launch Notebook". If you would like to
use a CPU-only notebook, click the dropdown arrow and select "Launch
CPU-only Notebook".

.. _notebook-configuration:

************************
 Notebook Configuration
************************

Notebooks may be supplied an optional *notebook configuration* to
control aspects of the notebook's environment. For example, to launch a
notebook that uses two GPUs:

.. code::

   $ det notebook start --config resources.slots=2

In addition to the ``--config`` flag, configuration may also be supplied
via a YAML file (``--config-file``):

.. code::

   $ cat > config.yaml <<EOL
   description: test-notebook
   resources:
     slots: 2
   bind_mounts:
     - host_path: /data/notebook_scratch
       container_path: /scratch
   EOL
   $ det notebook start --config-file config.yaml

See :ref:`command-notebook-configuration` for details on the supported
configuration options.

Finally, to configure notebooks to run a predefined set of commands at
startup (as with :ref:`experiments <startup-hooks>`), you can include a
`--context-dir` option:

.. code::

   $ mkdir my_context_dir
   $ echo "pip3 install pandas" > my_context_dir/startup-hook.sh
   $ det notebook start --context-dir my_context_dir

.. _cpu-only-notebooks:

Example: CPU-Only Notebooks
===========================

By default, each notebook is assigned a single GPU. This is appropriate
for some uses of notebooks (e.g., training a deep learning model) but
unnecessary for other tasks (e.g., analyzing the training metrics of a
previously trained model). To launch a notebook that does not use any
GPUs, set ``resources.slots`` to ``0``:

.. code::

   $ det notebook start --config resources.slots=0

.. _notebook-state:

*************************************
 Saving and Restoring Notebook State
*************************************

.. warning::

   It is only possible to save and restore notebook state on Determined
   clusters that are configured with a shared filesystem available to
   all agents.

To ensure that your work is saved even if your notebook gets terminated,
it is recommended to launch all notebooks with a shared filesystem
directory *bind-mounted* into the notebook container and work on files
inside of the bind mounted directory. For example, a user ``jimmy`` with
a shared filesystem home directory at ``/shared/home/jimmy`` could use
the following configuration to launch a notebook:

.. code::

   $ cat > config.yaml << EOL
   bind_mounts:
     - host_path: /shared/home/jimmy
       container_path: /shared/home/jimmy
   EOL
   $ det notebook start --config-file config.yaml

Working on a notebook file within the shared bind mounted directory will
ensure that your code and Jupyter checkpoints are saved on the shared
filesystem rather than an ephemeral container filesystem. If your
notebook gets terminated, launching another notebook and loading the
previous notebook file will effectively restore the session of your
previous notebook. To restore the *full* notebook state (in addition to
code), you can use Jupyter's ``File`` > ``Revert to Checkpoint``
functionality.

.. note::

   By default, JupyterLab will take a checkpoint every 120 seconds in an
   ``.ipynb_checkpoints`` folder in the same directory as the notebook
   file. To modify this setting, click on ``Settings`` > ``Advanced
   Settings Editor`` and change the value of ``"autosaveInternal"``
   under ``Document Manager``.
