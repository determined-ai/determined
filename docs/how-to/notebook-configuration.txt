Notebook Configuration
======================

Notebooks may be supplied an optional **notebook configuration** to
control aspects of the notebook's environment. For example, to launch a
notebook that uses two GPUs:

.. code::

   $ det notebook start --config resources.slots=2

In addition to the ``--config`` flag, configuration may also be supplied
via a YAML file (``--config-file``):

.. code::

   $ cat > config.yaml <<EOL
   description: test-notebook
   resources:
     slots: 2
   bind_mounts:
     - host_path: /data/notebook_scratch
       container_path: /scratch
   EOL
   $ det notebook start --config-file config.yaml

See :ref:`command-configuration` for full documentation of the supported
configuration options.

.. _cpu-only-notebooks:

Example: CPU-Only Notebooks
---------------------------

By default, each notebook is assigned a single GPU. This is useful for
some uses of notebooks (e.g., training a deep learning model) but
unnecessary for other tasks (e.g., analyzing the training
metrics of a previously trained model). To launch a notebook that does
not use any GPUs, set ``resources.slots`` to ``0``:

.. code::

   $ det notebook start --config resources.slots=0
