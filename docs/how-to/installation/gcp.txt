 Install Determined on GCP
###########################

This document describes how to deploy a Determined cluster on Google
Cloud Platform (GCP). We provide the ``determined-deploy`` package for
easy creation and deployment of these resources in GCP. The
``determined-deploy`` package uses `Terraform
<https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html>`__
to automatically deploy and configure a Determined cluster in GCP.
Alternatively, if you already have a process for setting up
infrastructure with Terraform, you can use our `Terraform modules
<https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/tree/master/deploy/determined_deploy/gcp/terraform>`__
rather than ``determined-deploy``.

For more information about using Determined on GCP, see the
:ref:`topic_guide_gcp` topic guide.

**************
 Requirements
**************

Project
=======

To get started on GCP, you will need to create a `project
<https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/building-app/creating-project>`__.

The following GCP APIs must be enabled on your GCP project:

-  `Cloud Resource Manager API
   <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com>`__
-  `Cloud SQL Admin API
   <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/sqladmin.googleapis.com>`__
-  `IAM API
   <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/iam.googleapis.com/overview>`__
-  `Service Networking API
   <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/servicenetworking.googleapis.com>`__

Credentials
===========

The ``determined-deploy`` package requires credentials in order to
create resources in GCP. There are two ways to provide these
credentials:

-  Use `gcloud
   <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive#installation_options>`__
   to authenticate your user account:

   .. code::

      gcloud auth application-default login

   This command will open a login page in your browser where you can
   sign in to the Google account that has access to your project. Ensure
   your user account has ``Owner`` access to the project you want to
   deploy your cluster in.

-  Use :ref:`service account credentials
   <gcp-service-account-credentials>`.

Resource Quotas
===============

The default `GCP Resource Quotas
<https://cloud.google.com/compute/quotas>`__ for GPUs are relatively
low; you may wish to request a quota increase.

.. _gcp-install:

*********
 Install
*********

#. Install `Terraform
   <https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html>`__.

#. Install ``determined-deploy`` using ``pip``:

   .. code::

      pip install determined-deploy

*********************
 Deploying A Cluster
*********************

We recommend creating a new directory and running the commands below
inside that directory.

.. note::

   The deployment process will create Terraform state and variables
   files in the directory where it is run. The state file keeps track of
   deployed resources and their state and is used to update or delete
   the cluster in the future. The variables files includes all Terraform
   variables used for deployment (e.g., service account keypath, cluster
   ID, GCP region and zone).

   Any future update or deletion commands should be run inside the same
   directory so ``determined-deploy`` can read the state and variables
   files. If either of these files is deleted, it will be difficult to
   manage the deployment afterward. Storing these files in a safe
   location is strongly recommended.

To deploy the cluster, run:

.. code::

   det-deploy gcp up --cluster-id CLUSTER_ID --project-id PROJECT_ID

``CLUSTER_ID`` is an arbitrary unique ID for the new cluster. We
recommend choosing a cluster ID that is memorable and helps identify
what the cluster is being used for.

The deployment process may take 5-10 minutes. When it completes, summary
information about the newly deployed cluster will be printed, including
the URL of the Determined master.

         available in your selected ``region`` and ``zone`` by referring
         to the `GPUs on Compute Engine
         <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus>`__ page.

      -  Intel Broadwell

   -  -  ``--local-state-path``
      -  Directory used to store cluster metadata. The same directory
         cannot be used for multiple clusters at the same time.
      -  Current working directory

The following ``gcloud`` commands will help to validate your
configuration, including resource availability in your desired region
and zone:

.. code::

   # Validate that the GCP Project ID exists.
   gcloud projects list

   # Verify that the environment_image is listed.
   gcloud compute images list --filter=name:<environment_image>

   # Check that a zone is available in the configured region.
   gcloud compute zones list --filter=region:<region>

   # List the available machine types (for master_machine_type and agent_machine_type) in the configured zone.
   gcloud compute machine-types list --filter=zone:<zone>

   # List the valid gpu_type values for the configured zone.
   gcloud compute accelerator-types list --filter=zone:<zone>

********************
 Updating A Cluster
********************

If you need to make changes to your cluster, you can rerun ``det-deploy
gcp up [args]`` in the same directory and your cluster will be updated.
The ``det-deploy`` tool will only replace resources that need to be
replaced based on the changes you've made in the updated execution.

.. note::

   If you'd like to change the ``region`` of a deployment after it has
   already been deployed, we recommend deleting the cluster first, then
   redeploying the cluster with the new ``region``.

**********************
 Destroying A Cluster
**********************

To bring down the cluster, run the following in the same directory where
you ran ``det-deploy gcp up``:

.. code::

   det-deploy gcp down

``det-deploy`` will use the ``.tfstate`` and ``terraform.tfvars.json``
files in the current directory to determine which resources to destroy.
If you deployed with a service account JSON key file, the same
credentials file will be used for deprovisioning. Otherwise, default
Google Cloud credentials are used.

.. _gcp-service-account-credentials:

Using Service Account Credentials
=================================

For more security controls, you can create a `service account
<https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started>`__ or
select an existing service account from the `service account key page in
the Google Cloud Console
<https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey>`__
and ensure it has the following IAM roles:

-  Cloud SQL Admin
-  Compute Admin
-  Compute Network Admin
-  Security Admin
-  Service Account Admin
-  Service Account User
-  Service Networking Admin
-  Storage Admin

Roles provide the service account permissions to create specific
resources in your project. You can add roles to service accounts
following this `guide
<https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts>`__.

Once you have a service account with the appropriate roles, go to the
`service account key page in the Google Cloud Console
<https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey>`__
and create a JSON key file. Save it to a location you'll remember; we'll
refer to the path to this key file as the ``keypath``, which is an
optional argument you can supply when using ``determined-deploy``. Once
you have the ``keypath`` you can use it to deploy a GCP cluster by
continuing the :ref:`installation <gcp-install>` section.
