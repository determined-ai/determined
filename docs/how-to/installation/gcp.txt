Install Determined on GCP
=========================
This document describes how to deploy a Determined cluster on Google
Cloud Platform (GCP). We provide the ``determined-deploy`` package for easy creation
and deployment of these resources in GCP.

For more information on using Determined on GCP, see the :ref:`topic_guide_gcp`
topic guide.


``determined-deploy`` Python Package
------------------------------------

The ``determined-deploy`` package uses `Terraform <https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html>`__ to automatically deploy and configure a Determined cluster in GCP. Alternatively, if you already have a process for setting up infrastructure with Terraform, you can use the `Terraform modules <https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/tree/master/deploy/determined_deploy/gcp/terraform>`__ separately outside of ``determined-deploy``.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project
_______

To get started on GCP, you will need to create a `project <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/building-app/creating-project>`__.

The following GCP APIs must be enabled on your GCP project:

* `Cloud Resource Manager API <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com>`__
* `Cloud SQL Admin API <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/sqladmin.googleapis.com>`__
* `IAM API <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/iam.googleapis.com/overview>`__
* `Service Networking API <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/servicenetworking.googleapis.com>`__


Credentials
___________

The ``determined-deploy`` package requires credentials in order to create resources in GCP. There are two ways to provide these credentials:

1. Use `gcloud <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive#installation_options>`__ to authenticate your user account:

.. code:: sh

   gcloud auth application-default login

This command will open a login page on your browser where you can sign-in to the Google account with access to your project. Ensure your user account has ``Owner`` access to the project you want to deploy your cluster in.

2. Or alternatively, you can use :ref:`Service Account credentials <gcp-service-account-credentials>`.

.. _gcp-install:

Install
~~~~~~~

1. Install `Terraform <https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html>`__.
2. Install ``determined-deploy``:

.. code:: sh

   pip install determined-deploy


Deploying
~~~~~~~~~

We recommend creating a new directory and running the commands below inside that directory. 

.. note::
  The deployment process will create a state file in the directory where it is run. The state file keeps track of the resources deployed and their state, which is used for future updates or to delete the cluster. Since the state file will reside in this directory, any future update or deletion commands should be run inside this same directory so ``determined-deploy`` can read the state file.

To deploy the cluster, run:

.. code:: sh

   det-deploy gcp up --cluster-id CLUSTER_ID --project-id PROJECT_ID

     - Description
     - Default Value

     - False

   * - ``--gpu-num``
     - The number of GPUs on each agent instance. Between 1-8 (more GPUs require more powerful ``agent-instance-type``). Refer to the `GPUs on Compute Engine <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus>`__ page for specific GCP requirements.

     - 10m
     - False

   * - ``--network``
     - The network to create (ensure there isn't a network with the same name already in the project, otherwise the deployment will fail).

     - Intel Broadwell
     - False


.. note::
  The deployment process may take 5-10 minutes and will return the ``Web-UI`` along with additional cluster information once resources have been created.


The following ``gcloud`` commands will help to validate your configuration, including resource availability in your desired region and zone:

.. code:: sh

    # Validate that the GCP Project ID exists
    gcloud projects list

    # Verify that the environment_image is listed
    gcloud compute images list --filter=name:<environment_image>

    # Check that a zone is available in the configured region
    gcloud compute zones list --filter=region:<region>

    # List the available machine types (for master_machine_type and agent_machine_type) in the configured zone
    gcloud compute machine-types list --filter=zone:<zone>

    # List the valid gpu_type values for the configured zone
    gcloud compute accelerator-types list --filter=zone:<zone>


Updating the cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to make changes to your cluster, you can re-run ``det-deploy gcp up [args]`` in the same directory and your cluster will be updated. The ``determined-deploy`` package will only replace resources that need to be replaced based on the changes you've made in the updated execution.

.. warning::
  If you'd like to change the ``region`` of a deployment after it has already been deployed, we recommend deleting the cluster first, then redeploying the cluster with the new ``region``.


De-provisioning the cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To bring down the cluster, run the following in the same directory where you ran the deploy command:

.. code:: sh

    det-deploy gcp down [optional args]

By default, ``determined-deploy`` will use the ``.tfstate`` file in the current directory to determine which resources to de-provision. In addition, the following are available optional arguments:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 50 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Argument
     - Description
     - Default Value
     - Required

   * - ``--keypath``
     - The path to the Service Account JSON key file if using a Service Account. Including this flag will supersede default Google Cloud user credentials.
     - None
     - False


.. warning::
  ``determined-deploy`` will not delete active agent instances when you de-provision the cluster. Generally, the master instance will shut down any inactive agents after an idle period, but if you'd like to de-provision the cluster while these agent instances exist, you must delete all agent instances first. You can find these agent instances by filtering for instances named ``det-agent-<cluster-id>`` and these agent(s) will have a full name in the form ``det-agent-<cluster-id>-<pet name>``.

.. _gcp-service-account-credentials:

Using Service Account Credentials
_________________________________

For more security controls, you can create a `Service Account <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started>`__ or select an existing Service Account from the `service account key page in the Google Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey>`__ and ensure it has the following IAM Roles:

   - Cloud SQL Admin
   - Compute Admin
   - Compute Network Admin
   - Security Admin
   - Service Account Admin
   - Service Account User
   - Service Networking Admin
   - Storage Admin

Roles provide the Service Account permissions to create specific resources in your project. You can add roles to Service Accounts following this `guide <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts>`__.

Once you have a Service Account with the appropriate roles, go to the `service account key page in the Google Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey>`__ and create a JSON key file. Save it to a location you'll remember; we'll refer to the path to this key file as the ``keypath``, which is an optional argument you can supply when using ``determined-deploy``. Once you have the ``keypath`` you can use it to deploy a GCP cluster by continuing the :ref:`installation <gcp-install>` section.
