 Install Determined Using det-deploy
#####################################

This document shows how to deploy Determined locally or in a production
cluster using the ``det-deploy`` command-line tool, which automates the
process of starting Determined as a collection of Docker containers.

In a typical production setup, the master and agents will run on
separate machines. They can also run on a single machine, which is
especially useful for local development. This guide provides
instructions for both scenarios.

*******************
 Preliminary Setup
*******************

Install ``det-deploy`` by running

.. code::

   pip install determined-deploy

.. _configuring-cluster-install:

**************************************
 Configuring and Starting the Cluster
**************************************

A configuration file is needed to set important values in the master,
such as where to save model checkpoints. For information about how to
create a configuration file, see :ref:`cluster-configuration`. There are
also :ref:`sample configuration files available <config-template>`.

.. note::

   ``det-deploy`` will use a default configuration file if you don't
   provide one. It also transparently manages PostgreSQL along with the
   master, so the configuration options related to those services do not
   need to be set.

Deploying a Single-Node Cluster
===============================

For local development or small clusters (such as a GPU workstation), you
may wish to install both a master and an agent on the same node. To do
this, run one of the following commands:

.. code::

   # If the machine has GPUs:
   det-deploy local cluster-up

   # If the machine doesn't have GPUs:
   det-deploy local cluster-up --no-gpu

This will start a master and an agent on that machine. To verify that
the master is running, navigate to ``http://<master-hostname>:8080`` in
a browser, which should bring up the Determined WebUI. If you're using
your local machine, for example, navigate to ``http://localhost:8080``.

In the WebUI, navigate to the ``Cluster`` page, where you should now see
slots available (either CPU or GPU, depending on what hardware is
available on the machine).

For production deployments, you'll want to :ref:`use a cluster
configuration file <configuring-cluster-install>`. To provide this
configuration file to ``det-deploy``, use:

.. code::

   det-deploy local cluster-up --master-config-path <path to master.yaml>

If you want to create more than one agent locally, you can use:

.. code::

   det-deploy local cluster-up --agents <number of agents>

Stopping a Single-Node Cluster
==============================

To stop a Determined cluster, on the machine where a Determined cluster
is currently running, run

.. code::

   det-deploy local cluster-down

.. note::

   ``det-deploy local cluster-down`` will not remove any agents created
   with ``det-deploy local agent-up``. To remove these agents, use
   ``det-deploy local agent-down``.

Deploying a Standalone Master
=============================

In many cases, your Determined cluster will be split across multiple
nodes. In this case you will need to start a master and agents
separately. In order to start a standalone master, run:

.. code::

   det-deploy local master-up

.. note::

   For production deployments, you'll want to :ref:`use a cluster
   configuration file. <configuring-cluster-install>` To provide this
   configuration file to ``det-deploy``, use the flag
   ``--master-config-path <path to master.yaml>``.

To stop a running master, run:

.. code::

   det-deploy local master-down

Deploying Agents
================

To deploy a standalone agent on a machine, run one of the following
commands:

.. code::

   # If the machine has GPUs:
   det-deploy local agent-up <master_hostname>

   # If the machine doesn't have GPUs:
   det-deploy local agent-up --no-gpu <master_hostname>

This will create an agent on that machine. To verify whether it has
successfully connected to the master, navigate to the WebUI and check
whether slots have appeared on the ``Cluster`` page.

To launch the agent into a specific resource pool, use the
``--agent-resource-pool`` flag:

.. code::

   det-deploy local agent-up --agent-resource-pool= <resource_pool> <master_hostname>

For more information about resource pools, see :ref:`resource-pools`.

To stop a running agent, run:

.. code::

   det-deploy local agent-down
