 Network Requirements

This document describes the networking requirements for Determined
clusters.

*************
 Performance
*************

For best performance, we recommend that the Determined master and agents
use the same physical network or VPC.

*****************
 Internet Access
*****************

-  The Determined Docker images are hosted on Docker Hub. Determined
   agents need access to Docker Hub, e.g., to build new images for user
   workloads.

-  If packages, data, or other resources needed by user workloads are
   hosted on the public Internet, Determined agents will need to be able
   to access them. Note that agents can be :ref:`configured to use
   proxies <agent-network-proxy>` when accessing network resources.

.. note::

   When using VPCs on a public cloud provider, additional steps may need
   to be taken to ensure that instances in the VPC can access the
   Internet:

   -  On GCP, the instances need to have an external IP address or a
      `GCP Cloud NAT <https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview>`_
      should be configured for the VPC.

   -  On AWS, the instances need to have a public IP address and a `VPC
      Internet Gateway
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html>`_
      should be configured for the VPC.

 Firewall Rules
****************

The firewall rules must satisfy the following requirements.

Master
======

The Determined master needs the following network access:

-  Inbound TCP to the master's network port from the Determined agent
   instances, as well as all machines where developers want to use the
   Determined CLI or WebUI. The default port is ``8443`` if TLS is
   enabled and ``8080`` if not.

-  Outbound TCP to all ports on the Determined agents.

Agents
======

Determined agents need the following network access:

-  Inbound TCP from all ports on the master to all ports on the agent.

-  Outbound TCP from all ports on the agent to the master's network
   port.

-  Outbound TCP to the services that host the Docker images, packages,
   data, and other resources that need to be accessed by user workloads.

   -  For example, if your data is stored on Amazon S3, ensure the
      firewall rules allow access to this data.

-  Inbound and outbound TCP on all ports to and from each Determined
   agent:

   -  Inbound and outbound TCP ports 1734 and 1750 are used for synchronization between trial containers.

   -  Inbound and outbound TCP port 12350 is used for internal SSH-based communication between trial containers.

   -  Inbound and outbound TCP port 12355 is used for GLOO rendezvous between trial containers.

   -  Inbound and outbound ephemeral ports in the range 1024-65536 are used for communication between trials via GLOO.

   -  For every GPU on each agent machine, an inbound and outbound ephemeral TCP port in the range 1024-65536 is used for communication between trials via NCCL.

   -  Two additional ephemeral TCP ports in the range 1024-65536 are used for additional intra-trial communication between trial containers.

   -  For Tensorboards, an inbound and outbound TCP port between 2600 - 2900 is used to connect the master and the tensorboard container.
