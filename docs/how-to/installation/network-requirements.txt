Network Requirements
====================

This document describes the networking requirements for Determined clusters.

Performance
-----------

For best performance, we recommend that the Determined master and agents use
the same physical network or VPC.

Internet Access
---------------

-  The Determined Docker images are hosted on Docker Hub. Determined agents need
   access to Docker Hub, e.g., to build new images for user workloads.

-  If packages, data, or other resources needed by user workloads are
   hosted on the public Internet, Determined agents will need to be able to
   access them. Note that agents can be :ref:`configured to use
   proxies <agent-network-proxy>` when accessing network resources.

.. note::
  When using VPCs on a public cloud provider, additional
  steps may need to be taken to ensure that instances in the VPC can
  access the Internet:

  * On GCP, the instances need to have an external IP address or a `GCP Cloud
    NAT <https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview>`_ should be configured for
    the VPC.
  * On AWS, the instances need to have a public IP address and a `VPC Internet
    Gateway
    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html>`_
    should be configured for the VPC.

.. _firewall-rules:

Firewall Rules
--------------

The firewall rules must satisfy the following requirements.

Master
~~~~~~

The Determined master needs the following network access:

-  Inbound TCP to the master's port from the Determined
   agent instances, as well as all machines where developers want to use
   the Determined CLI. The default port is ``8080``.
-  Outbound TCP to all ports on the Determined agents.

Agents
~~~~~~

Determined agents need the following network access:

-  Inbound TCP from all ports on the master to all ports on the agent.
-  Outbound TCP from all ports on the agent to the master's HTTP port
   (``8080`` by default).
-  Inbound and outbound TCP on all ports to and from each Determined agent.
-  Outbound TCP to the services that host the Docker images, packages,
   data, and other resources that need to be accessed by user workloads.

   -  For example, if your data is stored on Amazon S3, ensure the
      firewall rules allow access to this data.
