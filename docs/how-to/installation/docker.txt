 Install Determined Using Docker
#################################

*******************
 Preliminary Setup
*******************

#. :ref:`Install Docker <install-docker>` on all machines in the
   cluster. If the agent machines have GPUs, ensure that the
   :ref:`Nvidia Container Toolkit <validate-nvidia-container-toolkit>`
   on each one is working as expected.

#. Pull the official Docker image for PostgreSQL. We recommend using the
   version listed below.

   .. code::

      docker pull postgres:10

   This image is not provided by Determined AI; please see `its Docker
   Hub page <https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres>`_ for more information.

#. Pull the Docker image for the master or agent on each machine where
   these services will run. There is a single master container running
   in a :ref:`Determined cluster <det-system-architecture>`, and
   typically there is one agent container running on a given machine. A
   single machine can host both the master container and an agent
   container. Run the commands below, replacing ``VERSION`` with a valid
   Determined version, such as the current version, |version|:

   .. code::

      docker pull determinedai/determined-master:VERSION
      docker pull determinedai/determined-agent:VERSION

#. Assuming you are running multiple containerized services on the
   Determined master machine, optionally create the ``determined``
   network that we will use in the service startup commands below:

   .. code::

      docker network create determined

**************************************
 Configuring and Starting the Cluster
**************************************

PostgreSQL
==========

The following command starts the PostgreSQL container on the master
using the ``determined`` network created above:

.. code::

   docker run \
       --name determined-db \
       --network determined \
       -p 5432:5432 \
       -v determined_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
       -e POSTGRES_DB=determined \
       -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<DB password> \
       postgres:10

If the master will connect to PostgreSQL via Docker networking, exposing
port 5432 via the ``-p`` argument isn't necessary; however, you may
still want to expose it for administrative or debugging purposes. In
order to expose the port only on the master machine's loopback network
interface, pass ``-p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432`` instead of ``-p 5432:5432``.

Determined Master
=================

Determined master :ref:`configuration values <master-configuration>` can
come from a file, environment variables, or command-line arguments.

To start the master with a configuration file, we recommend starting
from our `default master configuration file
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/determined-ai/determined/master/master/packaging/master.yaml>`_,
which contains a listing of the available options and descriptions for
them. Download and edit the ``master.yaml`` configuration file as
appropriate and start the master container with the edited
configuration:

.. code::

   docker run \
       -v "$PWD"/master.yaml:/etc/determined/master.yaml \
       determinedai/determined-master:VERSION

To start the master with environment variables instead of a
configuration file:

.. code::

   docker run \
       --name determined-master \
       --network determined \
       -p 8080:8080 \
       -e DET_DB_HOST=determined-db \
       -e DET_DB_NAME=determined \
       -e DET_DB_PORT=5432 \
       -e DET_DB_USER=postgres \
       -e DET_DB_PASSWORD=<DB password> \
       determinedai/determined-master:VERSION

Note that this references the PostgreSQL container running on the
``determined`` Docker network created above. If you are running
PostgreSQL externally, specify the hostname for the PostgreSQL server in
place of ``determined-db``.

In order to prevent the master from listening on port 8080 on all
network interfaces on the master machine, you may specify the loopback
interface in the published port mapping, i.e., ``-p
127.0.0.1:8080:8080``.

Determined Agents
=================

As is the case for the master, Determined agent :ref:`configuration
values <agent-configuration>` can come from a file, environment
variables, or command-line arguments.

To start the agent with a configuration file, we recommend starting from
our `default agent configuration file
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/determined-ai/determined/master/agent/packaging/agent.yaml>`_,
which contains a listing of the available options and descriptions for
them. Download and edit the ``agent.yaml`` configuration file as
appropriate and start the agent container with the edited configuration:

.. code::

   docker run \
       -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
       -v "$PWD"/agent.yaml:/etc/determined/agent.yaml \
       determinedai/determined-agent:VERSION

Note that the agent container must bind mount the host's Docker daemon
socket. This allows the agent container to orchestrate the containers
that execute trials and other tasks.

If you are providing command-line arguments to the container (e.g.,
using ``--master-port`` as opposed to the ``DET_MASTER_PORT``
environment variable), ``run`` must be provided as the first argument:

.. code::

   docker run \
       -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
       -v "$PWD"/agent.yaml:/etc/determined/agent.yaml \
       determinedai/determined-agent:VERSION \
       run --master-port=8080

To start an agent container with environment variables instead of a
configuration file:

.. code::

   docker run \
       --name determined-agent \
       --network determined \
       -e DET_MASTER_HOST=<Determined master hostname or IP> \
       -e DET_MASTER_PORT=8080 \
       determinedai/determined-agent:VERSION

Note that if an agent container is running on the same machine as the
master container, you may use ``determined-master`` (or whatever the
name of the master container is) as the ``DET_MASTER_HOST``.

Determined internally makes use of `Fluent Bit
<https://fluentbit.io>`__. The agent uses the ``fluent/fluent-bit:1.5``
Docker image at runtime. It will attempt to pull the image
automatically; if the agent machines in the cluster are not able to
connect to Docker Hub, the image must be manually placed on them before
Determined can run. In order to specify a different image to use for
running Fluent Bit (generally to make use of a custom Docker
registry---the image should not normally need to be changed otherwise),
use the agent's ``--fluent-logging-image`` command-line option or
``fluent_logging_image`` config file option.

Selecting GPUs
--------------

The ``--gpus`` flag should be used to specify which GPUs the agent
container will have access to; without it, the agent will not have
access to any GPUs. For example:

.. code::

   # Use all GPUs.
   docker run --gpus all ...
   # Use any four GPUs (selected by Docker).
   docker run --gpus 4 ...
   # Use the GPUs with the given IDs or UUIDs.
   docker run --gpus '"device=1,3"' ...

GPUs can also be disabled and enabled at runtime using the ``det slot
disable`` and ``det slot enable`` CLI commands, respectively.

Docker Networking for Master and Agents
=======================================

As with any Docker container, the networking mode of the master and
agent containers can be changed using the ``--network`` option to
``docker run``. In particular, host mode networking (``--network host``)
can be useful to optimize performance and in situations where a
container needs to handle a large range of ports, as it does not require
network address translation (NAT) and no "userland-proxy" is created for
each port.

The host networking driver only works on Linux hosts, and is not
supported on Docker Desktop for Mac, Docker Desktop for Windows, or
Docker EE for Windows Server.

See `Docker's documentation <https://docs.docker.com/network/host/>`_
for more details.

**********************
 Managing the Cluster
**********************

By default, ``docker run`` will run in the foreground, so that a
container can be stopped simply by pressing Control-C. If you wish to
keep Determined running for the long term, consider running the
containers `detached
<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#detached--d>`_ and/or
with `restart policies
<https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically/>`_.
Using :ref:`our deployment tool <install-using-deploy>` is also an
option.
