 Dynamic Agents on GCP
#######################

This document describes how to install, configure, and upgrade a
deployment of Determined with dynamic agents on GCP. See
:ref:`elastic-infrastructure` for an overview of the elastic
infrastructure in Determined.

*********************
 System Requirements
*********************

Compute Engine Project
======================

The Determined master and the Determined agents are intended to run in
the same project.

Instance Labels
===============

When using dynamic agents on GCP, Determined identifies the Compute
Engine instances that it is managing using a configurable instance label
(see :ref:`gcp-cluster-configuration` for details). Administrators
should be careful to ensure that this label is not used by other Compute
Engine instances that are launched outside of Determined; if that
assumption is violated, unexpected behavior may occur.

Compute Engine Images
=====================

-  The Determined master node will run on a custom image that will be
   shared with you by Determined AI.
-  Determined agent nodes will run on a custom image that will be shared
   with you by Determined AI.

Compute Engine Machine Types
============================

-  The Determined master node should be deployed on a Compute Engine
   instance with >= 2 CPUs (Intel Broadwell or later), 4GB of RAM, and
   100GB of disk storage. This would be a Compute Engine
   ``n1-standard-2`` or more powerful.

.. _gcp-api-access:

GCP API Access
==============

-  The Determined master *needs* to run as a service account that has
   the permissions to manage Compute Engine instances. There are two
   options:

   #. Create a particular service account with the ``Compute Admin``
      role. Then set the Determined master to use this account. See
      `Compute Engine IAM roles
      <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam>`__ for more
      details on how to configure the service account.

      -  In order for the Determined agent to be associated with a
         service account, the Determined master needs to have access to
         service accounts. Please ensure the service account of the
         Determined master has the ``Service Account User`` role.

      -  In order for the Determined agent to use a shared VPC, the
         service account that the master runs with needs to have the
         ``Compute Network User`` role.

   #. Use the default service account and add the ``Compute Engine: Read
      Write`` scope.

-  Optionally, the Determined agent may be associated with a service
   account.

.. note::

   Access scopes are the legacy method of specifying permissions for
   your instance. A best practice is to set the full cloud-platform
   access scope on the instance, then securely limit the service
   account's API access with Cloud IAM roles. See `Access Scopes
   <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#accesscopesiam>`__
   for details.

.. _gcp-network-requirements:

Network Requirements
====================

See :ref:`network-requirements` for details.

.. _gcp-gpu-requirements:

Supported GPU Types
-------------------

The following GPU types are supported by Determined:

-  ``nvidia-tesla-t4``
-  ``nvidia-tesla-p100``
-  ``nvidia-tesla-p4``
-  ``nvidia-tesla-v100``
-  ``nvidia-tesla-k80``
-  ``nvidia-tesla-a100``

.. _gcp-cluster-configuration:

***********************
 Cluster Configuration
***********************

The Determined Cluster is configured with ``master.yaml`` file located
at ``/usr/local/determined/etc`` on the Determined master instance. We
need to configure GPU dynamic agents in each resource pool. See
:ref:`cluster-configuration` for details.

.. _gcp-attach-disk:

****************************************
 Attaching A Disk To Each Dynamic Agent
****************************************

If your input data set is on a persistent disk, you can attach that disk
to each dynamic agent by using the base instance configuration and
preparing commands. The following is an example configuration. See `REST
Resource: instances
<https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/insert>`__
for the full list of configuration options supported by GCP. See
`Formatting and mounting a zonal persistent disk
<https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting>`__
for more examples of formatting or mounting disks in GCP.

Here is an example master configuration to attach and mount a second
disk to each dynamic agent.

.. code:: yaml

   provider:
     startup_script: |
                     lsblk
                     mkdir -p /mnt/disks/second
                     mount -o discard,defaults /dev/sdb1 /mnt/disks/second
                     lsblk
     type: gcp
     base_config:
       disks:
         - mode: READ_ONLY
           boot: false
           source: zones/<zone>/disks/<the name of the existing disk>
           autoDelete: false
     boot_disk_size: 200
     boot_disk_source_image: projects/<project>/global/images/<image name>

.. note::

   If a specific non-root user needs to access the disk, please run the
   tasks linked with the POSIX UID/GID of the user (See
   :ref:`run-as-user` for details.) and grant access to the
   corresponding UID/GID.

You can use the following command to validate if Determined tasks can
read from the attached disk.

.. code::

   cat > command.yaml << EOF
   bind_mounts:
     - host_path: /mnt/disks/second
       container_path: /second
   EOF
   # Test attached read-only disk.
   det command run --config-file command.yaml ls -l /second

.. _gcp-pull-gcr:

**********************************
 Securely Pulling Images from GCR
**********************************

If you have expensive operations to perform at startup, it can be useful
to :ref:`add custom layers <custom-env>` to the task images Determined
provides. If you have store these images in a secure registry, such as
GCR, you can pull these images securely by using existing tooling like
`docker-credential-gcr
<https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/docker-credential-gcr>`__.

Here is an example master configuration of how to allow the agent to
inherit the permissions of the service account associated with a GCE
instance, for accessing GCR.

.. code:: yaml

   provider:
     container_startup_script: |
         export HOME=/root
         apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl docker.io
         curl -fsSL "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/docker-credential-gcr/releases/download/v1.5.0/docker-credential-gcr_linux_amd64-1.5.0.tar.gz" \
               | tar xz --to-stdout > /usr/bin/docker-credential-gcr && chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-credential-gcr
         docker-credential-gcr configure-docker

.. note::

   This is an example of an operation that requires use of
   ``container_startup_script``. Because docker credential helpers alter
   the docker client configuration to depend on the helper binary by
   name, it must be installed and configured in the container.

**************
 Installation
**************

These instructions describe how to install Determined for the first
time; for directions on how to upgrade an existing Determined
installation, see the :ref:`gcp-upgrades` section below.

Ensure that you are using the most up-to-date Determined images. Keep
the image IDs handy as we will need them later.

Master
======

To install the master, we will launch an instance from the Determined
master image.

Let's start by navigating to the Compute Engine Dashboard of the GCP
Console. Click "Create Instance" and follow the instructions below:

#. Choose Machine Type: we recommend a ``n1-standard-2`` or more
   powerful.

#. Configure Boot Disk:

   #. Choose Boot Disk Image: find the Determined master image in
      "Images" and click "Select".

   #. Set Boot Disk Size: set ``Size`` to be at least 100GB. If you have
      a previous Determined installation that you are upgrading, you
      want to use the snapshot or existing disk. This disk will be used
      to store all your experiment metadata and checkpoints.

#. Configure Identity and API access: choose the ``service account``
   according to :ref:`gcp-api-access`.

#. Configure Firewalls: choose or create a security group according to
   these :ref:`gcp-network-requirements`. Check off ``Allow HTTP
   traffic``.

#. Review and launch the instance.

#. SSH into the Determined master and edit the config at
   ``/usr/local/determined/etc/master.yaml`` according to the guide on
   :ref:`cluster-configuration`.

#. Start the Determined master by entering ``make -C
   /usr/local/determined enable-master`` into the terminal.

Agent
=====

There is no installation needed for the agent. The Determined master
will dynamically launch Determined agent instances based on the
:ref:`cluster-configuration`.

.. _gcp-upgrades:

**********
 Upgrades
**********

Upgrading an existing Determined installation with dynamic agents on GCP
requires the same steps as an installation without dynamic agents. See
:ref:`upgrades`.
