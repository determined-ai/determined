Installation Requirements
==========================

System Requirements
-------------------

A Determined cluster has the following requirements.

Software
~~~~~~~~

- The Determined agent and master nodes must be configured with Ubuntu
  16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, or CentOS 7, or with MacOS 10.13 or higher.

- The agent nodes must have :ref:`Docker installed <install-docker>`.

- To run jobs with GPUs, the Nvidia drivers must be installed on each
  Determined agent. Determined requires version >= 384.81 of the Nvidia
  drivers. (The Nvidia drivers can be installed as part of installing
  CUDA, but the rest of the CUDA toolkit is not required.)

Hardware
~~~~~~~~

- The Determined master node should be configured with at least 4 CPUs
  (Intel Broadwell or later), 8GB of RAM, and 200GB of free disk space.
  Note that the Determined master does not use GPUs.

- Each Determined agent node should be configured with at least 2 CPUs
  (Intel Broadwell or later), 4GB of RAM, and 50GB of free disk space. If
  using GPUs, Nvidia GPUs with compute capability 3.7 or greater are
  required (e.g., K80, P100, V100, GTX 1080, GTX 1080 Ti, TITAN, TITAN
  XP).

- Mac hardware 2010 or higher can also run a master and agent.

.. note::

   Most of the disk space required by the master is due to the
   experiment metadata database; if PostgreSQL is set up on a different
   machine, the disk space requirements for the master are minimal
   (~100MB).

.. _install-docker:

Installing Docker
-----------------

Docker is a dependency of several components of the Determined
system. For example, every agent node must have Docker installed to
allow it to run containerized workloads. Similarly, 

Install on Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Install the latest release of Docker and the Nvidia Container Toolkit:

   On Ubuntu:

   .. code::

      sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
      curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
      sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

      curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
      distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
      curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list

      sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends docker-ce nvidia-docker2
      sudo systemctl reload docker
      sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

   On CentOS:

   .. code::

      sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2
      sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

      distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
      curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/nvidia-docker.repo

      sudo yum install -y docker-ce nvidia-docker2
      sudo systemctl start docker

#. Log out and start a new terminal session. Verify that the current user
   is in the ``docker`` group and that the ``nvidia`` Docker runtime is
   installed:

   .. code::

      groups
      docker info | grep Runtimes

#. If using CentOS 7, `enable the persistent storage
   <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/159390>`_ of journalctl log
   messages so that logs are saved on machine reboot.

   .. code::

      sudo mkdir /var/log/journal
      sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal
      sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald

Install on MacOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Install `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_.

   .. code::

      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

#. Install Docker via Homebrew.

   .. code::

      brew cask install docker

#. Start Docker.

    .. code::

      open /Applications/Docker.app

Docker on MacOS does not support running containers that use GPUs. As a
result, Determined agents on MacOS will only be able to run CPU-based
workloads.
