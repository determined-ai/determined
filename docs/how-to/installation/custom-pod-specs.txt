 Custom Pod Specs
##################

In a :ref:`Determined cluster running on Kubernetes
<determined-on-kubernetes>`, tasks (e.g., experiments, notebooks) are
executed by launching one or more Kubernetes pods. Users can customize
these pods by providing custom `pod specs
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#pod-v1-core>`__.
Common use cases include assigning pods to specific nodes, specifying
additional volume mounts, and attaching permissions. Configuring pod
specs is not required to use Determined on Kubernetes.

In this topic guide, we will cover:

#. How Determined uses pod specs.
#. The different ways to configure custom pod specs.
#. Supported pod spec fields.
#. How to configuring default pod specs.
#. How to configuring per-task pods specs.

*******************************
 How Determined Uses Pod Specs
*******************************

All Determined tasks are launched as pods. Determined pods consists of
an initContainer named ``determined-init-container`` and a container
named ``determined-container`` which executes the workload. When users
provide a pod spec, Determined inserts the ``determined-init-container``
and ``determined-container`` into the provided pod spec. As described
below, users may also configure some of the fields for the
``determined-container``.

*****************************
 Ways to Configure Pod Specs
*****************************

Determined provides two ways to configure pod specs. When Determined is
installed, the system administrator can configure pod specs that are
used by default for all GPU and CPU tasks. In addition, users can
specify a custom pod spec for individual tasks (e.g., for an experiment
by specifying ``environment.pod_spec`` in the :ref:`experiment
configuration <experiment-configuration>`). If a custom pod spec is
specified for a task, it overrides the default pod spec (if any).

***************************
 Supported Pod Spec Fields
***************************

This section describes which fields users can and cannot configure when
specifying custom `pod specs
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#pod-v1-core>`__.

Determined does not currently support configuring:

-  Pod Name - Determined automatically assigns a name for every pod that
   is created.
-  Pod Namespace - Determined launches all tasks in the Namespace in
   which the Determined master is running.
-  Host Networking - This must be configured via the
   :ref:`master-configuration`.
-  Restart Policy - This is always set to ``Never``.

As part of their pod spec, users can specify ``initContainers`` and
``containers``. Additionally users can configure the
``determined-container`` that executes the task (e.g., training), by
setting the container name in the pod spec to ``determined-container``.
For the ``determined-container``, Determined currently supports
configuring:

-  Resource requests and limits (except GPU resources).
-  Volume mounts and volumes.

*******************
 Default Pod Specs
*******************

Default pod specs must be configured when :ref:`installing or upgrading
<install-on-kubernetes>` Determined. The default pod specs are
configured in ``values.yaml`` of the :ref:`Determined Helm chart
<helm-config>` under ``taskContainerDefaults.cpuPodSpec`` and
``taskContainerDefaults.gpuPodSpec``. The ``gpuPodSpec`` is applied to
all tasks that use GPUs (e.g., experiments, notebooks). ``cpuPodSpec``
is applied to all tasks that only use CPUs (e.g., TensorBoards, CPU-only
notebooks). Fields that are not specified will remain at their default
Determined values.

Example of configuring default pod specs in ``values.yaml``:

.. code:: yaml

   taskContainerDefaults:
     cpuPodSpec:
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: Pod
       metadata:
         labels:
           customLabel: cpu-label
       spec:
         containers:
           # Will be applied to the container executing the task.
           - name: determined-container
             volumeMounts:
               - name: example-volume
                 mountPath: /example-data
           # Custom sidecar container.
           - name: sidecar-container
             image: alpine:latest
         volumes:
           - name: example-volume
             hostPath:
               path: /data
     gpuPodSpec:
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: Pod
       metadata:
         labels:
           customLabel: gpu-label
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: determined-container
             volumeMounts:
               - name: example-volume
                 mountPath: /example-data
         volumes:
           - name: example-volume
             hostPath:
               path: /data

.. _per-task-pod-specs:

********************
 Per-Task Pod Specs
********************

In addition to default pod specs, it is also possible to configure
custom pod specs for individual tasks. When defining a custom pod spec
for a task, it will override the default pod spec if one is defined. Pod
specs for individual tasks can be configured under the ``environment``
field in the :ref:`experiment config <exp-environment>` (for
experiments) or the :ref:`task configuration
<command-notebook-configuration>` (for other tasks).

Example of configuring a pod spec for an individual task:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     pod_spec:
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: Pod
       metadata:
         labels:
           customLabel: task-specific-label
       spec:
         # Specify a pull secret for task container image.
         imagePullSecrets:
           name: regcred
         # Specify a service account that allows writing checkpoints to S3 (for EKS).
         serviceAccountName: <checkpoint-storage-s3-bucket>
         # Specify tolerations for scheduling on tainted nodes.
         tolerations:
           - key: "tained-nodegroup-name"
             operator: "Equal"
             value: "true"
             effect: "NoSchedule"
