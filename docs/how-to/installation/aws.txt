 Install Determined on AWS
###########################

This document describes how to deploy a Determined cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We provide
the :ref:`det deploy <determined-deploy>` tool for easy creation and deployment of these resources.
If you would rather create the cluster manually, see the :ref:`aws-manual-deployment` section below.

For more information about using Determined on AWS, see the :ref:`topic_guide_aws` topic guide.

.. _determined-deploy:

*********************
 ``det deploy`` tool
*********************

The ``det deploy`` tool is provided by the ``determined`` Python package. It uses `AWS
CloudFormation <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/>`__ to automatically deploy and configure a
Determined cluster. CloudFormation builds the necessary components for Determined into a single
CloudFormation stack.

Requirements
============

-  Either AWS credentials or an IAM role with permissions to access AWS CloudFormation APIs. See the
   `AWS Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html>`__
   for information on how to use AWS credentials.

-  An `AWS EC2 Keypair <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html>`__.

You may also want to increase the `EC2 instance limits
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>`__ on your account
--- the `default instance limits
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-on-demand-instances.html#ec2-on-demand-instances-limits>`__
are quite low, particularly for GPU instances. For example, by default an AWS account can only
create 128 vCPUs worth of P-type instances in a given AWS region. The default configuration for
``det deploy`` can result in launching up to 5 ``p2.8xlarge`` instances (which have 32 vCPUs each),
which would exceed the default quota. AWS instance limits can be increased by submitting a request
to the `AWS Support Center
<https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-ec2-instances>`__.

Installation
============

``det`` command line tool can be installed using ``pip``:

.. code::

   pip install determined

Deploying
=========

The basic command to deploy a cluster is as follows:

.. code::

   det deploy aws up --cluster-id CLUSTER_ID --keypair KEYPAIR_NAME

``CLUSTER_ID`` is an arbitrary unique ID for the new cluster. We recommend choosing a cluster ID
that is memorable and helps identify what the cluster is being used for. The cluster ID will be used
as the AWS CloudFormation stack name.

``KEYPAIR_NAME`` is the name of the AWS EC2 key pair to use when provisioning the cluster. If the
AWS CLI is installed on your machine, you can get a list of the available keypair names by running
``aws ec2 describe-key-pairs``.

The deployment process may take 5--10 minutes. When it completes, summary information about the
newly deployed cluster will be printed, including the URL of the Determined master.

.. _determined-deploy-deployment-types:

Deployment Types
================

``det deploy`` supports multiple different deployment types to work with different security needs.
The deployment type can be specified using the ``--deployment-type`` argument (e.g., ``det deploy
aws --deployment-type secure``).

-  ``simple``: The simple deployment provides an easy way to deploy a Determined cluster in AWS.
   This creates the master instance in the default subnet for the account.

-  ``vpc``: The VPC deployment creates a separate VPC with public subnets; the Determined cluster is
   deployed into these subnets.

-  ``efs``: The EFS deployment creates an `EFS <https://aws.amazon.com/efs/>`_ drive and a
   Determined cluster into a separate VPC. The EFS drive attaches to agent instances at
   ``/mnt/efs``. This path is automatically bind-mounted into the task containers.

-  ``fsx``: The FSX deployment creates a `Lustre FSx <https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/>`_ drive
   and a Determined cluster into a separate VPC. The FSx drive attaches to agent instances at
   ``/mnt/fsx``. This path is automatically bind-mounted into the task containers.

-  ``secure``: The secure deployment creates resources to lock down the Determined cluster. These
   resources are:

   -  A VPC with a public and private subnet
   -  A NAT gateway for the private subnet to make outbound connections
   -  An S3 VPC gateway so the private subnet can access S3
   -  A bastion instance in the public subnet
   -  A master instance in the private subnet

CLI Arguments

Printing the default ``master.yaml`` template
---------------------------------------------

.. code::

   det deploy aws dump-master-config-template

.. _aws-master-yaml-template:

Custom master.yaml templates
============================

Advanced users who require a deep customization of master settings (i.e., the ``master.yaml`` config
file) can use the ``master.yaml`` templating feature. Since ``det deploy aws`` fills in plenty of
infrastructure-related values such as VPC subnet ids or IAM instance profile roles, we provide a
simplified templating solution, similar to :ref:`helm charts in kubernetes <install-on-kubernetes>`.
Template language is based on golang templates, and includes ``sprig`` helper library and ``toYaml``
serialization helper.

Example workflow:

#. Get the default template using

   .. code::

      det deploy aws dump-master-config-template > /path/to/master.yaml.tmpl

#. Customize the template as you see fit by editing it in any text editor. For example, let's say a
   user wants to utilize (default) ``p2.8xlarge`` 4-GPU instances for the :ref:`default compute pool
   <resource-pools>`, but they also often run single-GPU notebook jobs, for which a single
   ``p2.xlarge`` instance would be perfect. So, you want to add a third pool ``compute-pool-solo``
   with a customized instance type.

   Start with the default template, and find the ``resource_pools`` section:

   .. code:: yaml

      resource_pools:
        - pool_name: aux-pool
          max_aux_containers_per_agent: {{ .resource_pools.pools.aux_pool.max_aux_containers_per_agent }}
          provider:
            instance_type: {{ .resource_pools.pools.aux_pool.instance_type }}
            {{- toYaml .resource_pools.aws | nindent 6}}

        - pool_name: compute-pool
          max_aux_containers_per_agent: 0
          provider:
            instance_type: {{ .resource_pools.pools.compute_pool.instance_type }}
            cpu_slots_allowed: true
            {{- toYaml .resource_pools.aws | nindent 6}}

   Then, append a new section:

   .. code:: yaml

      - pool_name: compute-pool-solo
        max_aux_containers_per_agent: 0
        provider:
          instance_type: p2.8xlarge
          {{- toYaml .resource_pools.aws | nindent 6}}

#. Use the new template:

   .. code::

      det deploy aws <ALL PREVIOUSLY USED FLAGS> --master-config-template-path /path/to/edited/master.yaml.tmpl

#. All set! Check the `Cluster` page in WebUI to ensure your cluster has 3 resource pools. In case
   of errors, ssh to the master instance as instructed by ``det deploy aws`` output, and check
   ``/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`` or ``sudo docker logs determined-master``.

.. _aws-modifying-deployment:

Modifying a Deployment
======================

To modify an already deployed cluster you have a few options:

#. If what you'd like to change is provided as a ``det deploy`` CLI option, you can re-deploy the
   cluster using ``det deploy``. Use the same full ``det deploy`` command as on cluster creation,
   but update the options as necessary, while keeping the ``cluster-id`` the same. ``det deploy``
   will then find the existing cluster, take it down, and spin up a new one with the updated
   options.

#. If you want more control over the master configuration while minimizing downtime, you can SSH
   into the master instance using the private key from the keypair that was used to provision the
   cluster. Once you're successfully connected, you can modify ``master.yaml`` under
   ``/usr/local/determined/etc`` and restart the master Docker container for your changes to take
   effect:

   .. code:: bash

      sudo docker container restart determined-master

   For example, if you want to add or modify resource pools you can edit the master configuration
   file at ``/usr/local/determined/etc/master.yaml`` and add a new resource pool entry.

.. _aws-manual-deployment:

*******************
 Manual Deployment
*******************

Database
========

Determined requires a PostgreSQL-compatible database, such as AWS Aurora. Configure the cluster to
use the database by including the database information in ``master.yaml``. Make sure to create a
database before running the Determined cluster (e.g., ``CREATE DATABASE <database-name>``).

Example ``master.yaml`` snippet:

.. code:: yaml

   db:
     user: "${database-user}"
     password: "${database-password}"
     host: "${database-hostname}"
     port: 5432
     name: "${database-name}"

Security Groups
===============

VPC Security Groups provide a set of rules for inbound and outbound network traffic. The
requirements for a Determined cluster are:

Master
------

-  Egress on all ports to agent security group
-  Egress on all ports to the Internet
-  Ingress on port 8080 for access the Determined WebUI and REST APIs
-  Ingress on port 22 for SSH (recommended but not required)
-  Ingress on all ports from agent security group

Example:

.. code:: yaml

   MasterSecurityGroupEgress:
     Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupEgress
     Properties:
       GroupId: !GetAtt MasterSecurityGroup.GroupId
       DestinationSecurityGroupId: !GetAtt AgentSecurityGroup.GroupId

       ToPort: 65535
       IpProtocol: tcp

   MasterSecurityGroupInternet:
     Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupEgress
     Properties:
       GroupId: !GetAtt MasterSecurityGroup.GroupId
       CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
       FromPort: 0
       ToPort: 65535
       IpProtocol: tcp

       FromPort: 8080
       ToPort: 8080
       IpProtocol: tcp
       CidrIp: !Ref InboundCIDRRange

   MasterSSHIngress:
     Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress
     Properties:
       GroupId: !GetAtt MasterSecurityGroup.GroupId
       IpProtocol: tcp
       FromPort: 22
       ToPort: 22

       ToPort: 22
       CidrIp: !Ref InboundCIDRRange

IAM Roles
=========

IAM roles comprise IAM policies, which provide access to AWS APIs such as the EC2 or S3 API. The IAM
policies needed for the Determined cluster are:

Master
------

-  Allow EC2 to assume role
-  Allow EC2 to describe, create, and terminate instances with agent role
-  Allow EC2 to describe, create, and terminate spot instance requests (only required if using spot
   instances)

                 Resource: "*"

Master Node
===========

The master node should be deployed on an EC2 instance with at least 4 CPUs (Intel Broadwell or
later), 8GB of RAM, and 200GB of disk storage. This roughly corresponds to an EC2 t2.large instance
or better. The AMI should be the default Ubuntu 18.04 AMI.

Running Determined
------------------

#. Install Docker and create the ``determined`` Docker network.

   .. code::

      apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
      apt-get update
      apt-get install -y \
        apt-transport-https \
        ca-certificates \
        curl \
        gnupg-agent \
        software-properties-common
      curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
      add-apt-repository \
        "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
        $(lsb_release -cs) \
        stable"
      apt-get update
      apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

      docker network create determined

#. Configure the cluster with ``master.yaml``. See :ref:`cluster-configuration` for more
   information.

   Notes:

   -  ``image_id`` should be the latest Determined agent AMI.
   -  ``instance_type`` should be any p2 or p3 EC2 instance type.
   -  For more information about resource pools, see :ref:`resource-pools`

   .. warning::

      An important assumption of Determined with Dynamic Agents is that any EC2 instances with the
      configured tag_key:tag_value pair are managed by the Determined master. This pair should be
      unique to your Determined installation. If it is not, Determined may inadvertently manage your
      non-Determined EC2 instances.

      If using spot instances, Determined also assumes that any EC2 spot instance requests with the
      configured tag_key:tag_value pair are managed by the Determined master.
