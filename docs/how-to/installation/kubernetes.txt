 Install Determined on Kubernetes
##################################

This document describes how to install Determined on `Kubernetes
<https://kubernetes.io/>`__. The installation is performed using the
:download:`Determined Helm Chart </helm/determined-0.5.0.tgz>`. For
general information about using Determined with Kubernetes, refer the
:ref:`determined-on-kubernetes` guide.

***************
 Prerequisites
***************

Before installing Determined on a Kubernetes cluster, please ensure that
the following prerequisites are satisfied:

-  The Kubernetes cluster should be running Kubernetes >= 1.15

-  The Kubernetes cluster should have `GPU support
   <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-gpus/scheduling-gpus/>`_
   enabled.

-  You should have access to the cluster via `kubectl
   <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/>`_.

-  `Helm 3 <https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/>`_ should be installed.

-  If you are using a private image registry or the enterprise edition,
   you should add a secret using `kubectl create secret
   <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/>`_.

-  The nodes in the cluster already have or can pull the
   ``fluent/fluent-bit:1.6`` Docker image from Docker Hub.

You should also download a copy of the :download:`Determined Helm Chart
</helm/determined-0.5.0.tgz>` and extract it on your local machine.

If you do not yet have a Kubernetes cluster deployed and you want to use
Determined in a public cloud environment, we recommend using a managed
Kubernetes offering such as `Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
<https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine>`__ on GCP or `Elastic
Kubernetes Service (EKS) <https://aws.amazon.com/eks/>`__ on AWS. For
more info on configuring GKE for use with Determined, refer to our
:ref:`Instructions for setting up a GKE cluster <setup-gke-cluster>`.
For info on configuring EKS, refer to our :ref:`Instructions for setting
up an EKS cluster <setup-eks-cluster>`.

*********************
 What Gets Installed
*********************

When the Determined Helm chart is installed, the following entities will
be created:

#. Deployment of the Determined master.

#. ConfigMap containing configurations for the Determined master.

#. LoadBalancer service to make the Determined master accessible. Later
   in this guide, we describe how it is possible to replace this with a
   NodePort service.

#. ServiceAcccount which will be used by the Determined master.

#. Deployment of a Postgres database. Later in this guide, we describe
   how an external database can be used instead.

#. PersistentVolumeClaim for the Postgres database. Omitted if using an
   external database.

#. Service to allow the Determined master to communicate with the
   Postgres database. Omitted if using an external database.

***************
 Configuration
***************

When installing Determined using Helm, you should first configure some
aspects of the Determined deployment by editing the ``values.yaml`` and
``Chart.yaml`` files in the Helm chart.

Image Registry Configuration
============================

To configure which image registry of Determined will be installed by the
Helm chart, users should modify ``imageRegistry`` in ``values.yaml``.
Users can specify our DockerHub public registry ``determinedai`` or
specify any private registry that hosts the Determined master image.

Image Pull Secret Configuration
===============================

To configure which image pull secret will be used by the Helm chart,
users should modify ``imagePullSecretName`` in ``values.yaml``. Users
can set it to empty for our DockerHub public registry or specify any
secret that is configured using `kubectl create secret
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/>`_.

.. _configure-determined-kubernetes-version:

Version Configuration
=====================

To configure which version of Determined will be installed by the Helm
chart, users should modify ``appVersion`` in ``Chart.yaml``. Users can
specify a release version (e.g., ``0.13.0``) or specify any commit hash
from the `upstream Determined repo
<https://github.com/determined-ai/determined>`_ (e.g.,
``b13461ed06f2fad339e179af8028d4575db71a81``). Users are strongly
encouraged to use a released version.

Number of GPUs Per Node
=======================

Users are required to specify the number of GPUs on each node (for
GPU-enabled nodes only). This is done by setting ``maxSlotsPerPod`` in
``values.yaml``. Determined uses this information when scheduling
multi-GPU tasks. Each multi-GPU (distributed training) task will be
scheduled as a set of ``slotsPerTask / maxSlotsPerPod`` separate pods,
with each pod assigned up to ``maxSlotsPerPod`` GPUs. Distributed tasks
with sizes that are not divisible by ``maxSlotsPerPod`` are never
scheduled. If you have a cluster of different size nodes, set
``maxSlotsPerPod`` to the greatest common divisor of all the sizes. For
example, if you have some nodes with 4 GPUs and other nodes with 8 GPUs,
set ``maxSlotsPerPod`` to ``4`` so that all distributed experiments will
launch with 4 GPUs per pod (with two pods on 8-GPU nodes).

Checkpoint Storage
==================

Checkpoints and TensorBoard events can be configured to be stored in
``shared_fs``, `AWS S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`__, or `GCS
<https://cloud.google.com/storage>`__. By default, checkpoints and
TensorBoard events are stored using ``shared_fs``, which creates a
`hostPath Volume
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath>`__ and
saves to the host file system. This configuration is intended for
*initial testing only*; users are strongly discouraged from using
``shared_fs`` for actual deployments of Determined on Kubernetes,
because most Kubernetes cluster nodes do not have a shared file system.

Instead of using ``shared_fs``, users should configure either AWS S3 or
GCS:

-  **AWS S3**: To configure Determined to use AWS S3 for checkpoint and
   TensorBoard storage, users need to set ``checkpointStorage.type`` in
   ``values.yaml`` to ``s3`` and set ``checkpointStorage.bucket`` to the
   name of the bucket. The pods launched by the Determined master must
   have read, write, and delete access to the bucket. To enable this
   users may optionally configure ``checkpointStorage.accessKey`` and
   ``checkpointStorage.secretKey``. Users may also optionally configure
   ``checkpointStorage.endpointUrl`` which specifies the endpoint to use
   for S3 clones (e.g.,
   ``http://<minio-endpoint>:<minio-port|default=9000>``).

-  **GCS**: To configure Determined to use Google Cloud Storage for
   checkpoints and TensorBoard data, users need to set
   ``checkpointStorage.type`` in ``values.yaml`` to ``gcs`` and set
   ``checkpointStorage.bucket`` to the name of the bucket. The pods
   launched by the Determined master must have read, write, and delete
   access to the bucket. For example, when launching their `GKE nodes
   <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/node-pools/create>`__
   users need to specify ``--scopes=storage-full`` to configure proper
   GCS access.

Default Pod Specs (Optional)
============================

As described in the :ref:`determined-on-kubernetes` guide, when tasks
(e.g., experiments, notebooks) are started in a Determined cluster
running on Kubernetes, the Determined master launches pods to execute
these tasks. The Determined helm chart makes it possible to set default
pod specs for all CPU and GPU tasks. The defaults can be defined in
``values.yaml`` under ``taskContainerDefaults.cpuPodSpec`` and
``taskContainerDefaults.gpuPodSpec``. For examples of how to do this and
a description of permissible fields please see the :ref:`specifying
custom pod specs <custom-pod-specs>` guide.

Default Password (Optional)
===========================

Unless otherwise specified, the pre-existing users, ``admin`` and
``determined``, do not have passwords associated with their accounts.
Users can set a default password for the ``determined`` and ``admin``
accounts if preferred or needed. This password will not affect any other
user account. For additional information on managing users in
determined, see our :ref:`topic guide on users <users>`.

Database (Optional)
===================

By default, the Helm chart will deploy an instance of Postgres on the
same Kubernetes cluster where Determined itself is deployed. If this is
undesirable, users can configure the Helm chart to use an external
Postgres database by setting ``db.hostAddress`` to the IP address of
their database. If ``db.hostAddress`` is configured, the Determined Helm
chart will not deploy a database.

TLS (Optional)
==============

By default, the Helm chart will deploy a load-balancer which makes the
Determined master accessible over HTTP. To secure your cluster,
Determined supports configuring `TLS encryption
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`__ which can be
configured to terminate inside a load-balancer or inside the Determined
master itself. To configure TLS, users should set
``useNodePortForMaster`` to ``true``. This will instruct Determined to
deploy a NodePort service for the master. Users can then configure an
`Ingress
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls>`__
that performs TLS termination in the load balancer and forward plain
test to the NodePort service, or forwards TLS encrypted data. Please
note when configuring an Ingress that you need to have an `Ingress
controller
<https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller>`__
runing your cluster.

#. **TLS termination in a load-balancer (e.g., nginx).** This option
   will provide TLS encryption between the client and the load-balancer,
   with all communication inside the cluster performed via http. To
   configure this option set ``useNodePortForMaster`` to ``true`` and
   then configure an Ingress service to perform TLS termination and
   forward the plain text traffic to the Determined master.

#. **TLS termination in the Determined master.** This option will
   provide TLS encrytption inside the Kubernetes cluster. All
   communication with the master will encrypted. Communication between
   task containers (distributed triaining) will not be encrypted. To
   configure this option create a Kuberentes TLS secret within the
   namespace where Determined is being installed and set ``tlsSecret``
   to be the name of this secret. Users will also have to set
   ``useNodePortForMaster`` to ``true``. Once the the NodePort service
   is created, users can configure an Ingress to forward TLS encrypted
   data to the NodePord service.

An example of how to configure an Ingress, by default this Ingress will
perform TLS termination in the load-balancer:

.. code:: yaml

   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: determined-ingress
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"

       # Uncommenting this option instucts the created load-balancer
       # to forward TLS encrypted data to the NodePort service and
       # perform TLS termination in the Determined master. In order
       # to configure ssl-passthrough, your nginx ingress controller
       # must be running with --enable-ssl-passthrough option enabled.
       #
       # nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: "true"
   spec:
     tls:
     - hosts:
       - your-hostname-for-determined.ai
       secretName: your-tls-secret-name
     rules:
     - host: your-hostname-for-determined.ai
       http:
         paths:
           - path: /
             backend:
               serviceName: determined-master-service-<name for your deployment>
               servicePort: masterPort configured in values.yaml

Default Scheduler (Optional)
============================

Determined includes support for the `lightweight coscheduling plugin
<https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/tree/release-1.18/pkg/coscheduling>`__,
which extends the default Kubernetes scheduler to provide gang
scheduling. This feature is currently in beta and is not enabled by
default. To activate the plugin, set the ``defaultScheduler`` field to
``coscheduler``. If the field is empty or doesn't exist, Determined will
use the default Kubernetes scheduler to schedule all experiments and
tasks.

.. code:: yaml

   defaultScheduler: coscheduler

***********************
 Installing Determined
***********************

Once finished making configuration changes in ``values.yaml`` and
``Chart.yaml``, Determined is ready to be installed. To install
Determined run:

.. code::

   helm install <name for your deployment> determined-helm-chart

``determined-helm-chart`` is a relative path to where the
:download:`Determined Helm Chart </helm/determined-0.5.0.tgz>` is
located. It may take a few minutes for all resources to come up. If you
encounter issues during installation please follow our list of
:ref:`useful kubectl commands <useful-kubectl-commands>`. Helm will
install Determined within the default namespace. If you wish to install
Determined into a non-default namespace, add ``-n <namespace name>`` to
the command shown above.

Once the installation has completed, instructions will be displayed for
discovering the IP address assigned to the Determined master. The IP
address can also be discovered by running ``kubectl get services``.

**********************
 Upgrading Determined
**********************

To upgrade Determined or to change a configuration setting, first make
the appropriate changes in ``values.yaml`` and ``Chart.yaml``, and then
run:

.. code::

   helm upgrade <name for your deployment> --wait determined-helm-chart

Before upgrading Determined, consider pausing all active experiments.
Any experiments that are active when the Determined master restarts will
resume training after the upgrade, but will be rolled back to their most
recent checkpoint.

*************************
 Uninstalling Determined
*************************

To uninstall Determined run:

.. code::

   # Please note that if the Postgres Database was deployed by Determined, it will
   # be deleted by this command, permanently removing all records of your experiments.
   helm delete <name for your deployment>

   # If there were any active tasks when uninstalling, this command will
   # delete all of the leftover Kubernetes resources. It is recommended to
   # pause all experiments prior to upgrading or uninstalling Determined.
   kubectl get pods --no-headers=true -l=determined | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete pod
