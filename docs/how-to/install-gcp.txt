Install Determined on GCP
=========================
This document describes how to deploy a Determined cluster on Google
Cloud Platform (GCP). We provide the ``determined-deploy`` package for easy creation
and deployment of these resources in GCP.

For more information on using Determined on GCP, see the :ref:`topic_guide_gcp`
topic guide.


``determined-deploy`` Python Package
------------------------------------

The ``determined-deploy`` package uses `Terraform <https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html>`__ to automatically deploy and configure a Determined cluster in GCP. Alternatively, if you already have a process for setting up infrastructure with Terraform, you can use the `Terraform modules <https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/tree/master/deploy/determined_deploy/gcp/terraform>`__ separately outside of `determined-deploy`.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project
_______

To get started on GCP, you will need to create a `project <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/building-app/creating-project>`__.

The following GCP APIs must be enabled on your GCP project:

* `Cloud Resource Manager API <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com>`__
* `Cloud SQL Admin API <https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api>`__
* `IAM API <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/iam.googleapis.com/overview>`__
* `Service Networking API <https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-networking/getting-started>`__


Credentials
___________

``determined-deploy`` requires credentials in order to create resources in GCP. There are two ways to provide these credentials:

1. Use `gcloud <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive#installation_options>`__ to authenticate your user account:

.. code::

   gcloud auth application-default login

This command will open a login page on your browser where you can sign-in to the Google account with access to your project. Ensure your user account has at least ``Editor`` access to the project you want to deploy your cluster in.


2. For more security controls, you can create a `Service Account <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started>`__ or select an existing Service Account from the `service account key page in the Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey>`__ and ensure it has the following IAM Roles:

   - Cloud SQL Admin
   - Compute Admin
   - Compute Network Admin
   - Security Admin
   - Service Account Admin
   - Service Account User
   - Service Networking Admin
   - Storage Admin

Roles provide the Service Account permissions to create specific resources in your project. You can add roles to Service Accounts following this `guide <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts>`__.

Once you have a Service Account with the appropriate roles, go to the `service account key page in the Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey>`__ and create a JSON key file. Save it to a location you'll remember; we'll refer to the  path to this key file as the ``keypath`` going forward.


Install
~~~~~~~

1. Install `Terraform <https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html>`__.
2. Install ``determined-deploy``

.. code::

   pip install -U determined-deploy


Deploying
~~~~~~~~~

We recommend creating a new directory and running the commands below inside that directory. 

.. note::
  The deployment process will create a state file in the directory where it is run. The state file keeps track of the resources deployed and their state, which is used for future updates or to delete the cluster. Since the state file will reside in this directory, any future updates or deletions should be run inside this same directory so ``determined-deploy`` can read the state file.

To deploy the cluster, run:

.. code::

   det-deploy gcp [required args] [options]

The three required arguments are:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 50 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Argument
     - Description
     - Default Value

   * - ``--keypath``
     - The path to the Service Account JSON key file or the string ``gcloud`` if you've authenticated with gcloud (option 1) above.
     - None

   * - ``--identifier``
     - A string appended to resources to uniquely identify the cluster.
     - None

   * - ``--project_id``
     - The project to deploy the cluster in.
     - None


The following are optional arguments that may be useful when deploying your Determined cluster:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 50 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Argument
     - Description
     - Default Value

   * - ``--det_version``
     - The Determined version or commit id to deploy. 
     - The version of ``determined-deploy``.

   * - ``--local_state_path``
     - The absolute path to store ``.tfstate`` files. The `.tfstate` file tracks the resources you've deployed, which allows you to update or delete deployments later.
     - The current working directory where ``determined-deploy`` is being run.

   * - ``--preemptible``
     - Whether to use preemptible instances.
     - false

   * - ``--gpu_type``
     - The type of GPU to use for the agent instances.
     - nvidia-tesla-v100

   * - ``--gpu_num``
     - The number of GPUs on each agent instance. Between 1-8 (more GPUs require more powerful ``agent_instance_type``)
     - 2

   * - ``--max_instances``
     - The maximum number of agent instances at one time.
     - 4

   * - ``--max_idle_agent_period``
     - The maximum amount of time an aagent can sit idle before being shut down.
     - 30m

   * - ``--network``
     - The name of the network to deploy the cluster in. The network will be created if it doesn't exist.
     - det-default 

   * - ``--region``
     - The region to deploy the cluster in.
     - us-central-1

   * - ``--zone``
     - The zone to deploy the cluster in.
     - us-central-1a

   * - ``--master_instance_type``
     - Instance type to use for the master instance.
     - n1-standard-16

   * - ``--agent_instance_type``
     - Instance type to use for the agent instances.
     - n1-standard-16

.. note::
  The deployment process may take 5-10 minutes and will return the ``web_ui`` to indicate that the resources have been created. It may take a few minutes from this point for the master instance to fully boot up and you're able to use the ``web_ui`` address to access the cluster. 

.. warning::
  Changes to ``--gpu_num`` should correspond to appropriate changes to ``--agent_instance_type``, as enforced by Google Cloud. For example, when using ``nvidia-tesla-v100`` GPUs, each GPU can correspond to at most 12vCPUs, i.e. if ``--gpu_num 2``, then ``--agent_instance_type n1-standard-16`` is the highest number of vCPUs (16) that can be used.

.. warning::
  If ``det-deploy`` is set to use an existing network, the VPC being used must have an `IP range allocated <https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-services-access#procedure>`__ and a `private service connection created <https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-services-access#creating-connection>`__.


The following ``gcloud`` commands will help to validate your configuration, including resource availability in your desired region and zone:

.. code::

    # Validate that the GCP Project ID exists
    gcloud projects list

    # Verify that the environment_image is listed
    gcloud compute images list --filter=name:<environment_image>

    # Check that a zone is available in the configured region
    gcloud compute zones list --filter=region:<region>

    # List the available machine types (for master_machine_type and agent_machine_type) in the configured zone
    gcloud compute machine-types list --filter=zone:<zone>

    # List the valid gpu_type values for the configured zone
    gcloud compute accelerator-types list --filter=zone:<zone>


Updating the cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to make changes to your cluster, you can re-run ``det-deploy [required args] [options]`` in the same directory and your cluster will be updated. ``determined-deploy`` will only replace resources that need to be replaced based on the changes you've made in the updated execution. 

.. note::
  If you previously created your cluster and set a ``local_state_path`` other than the default, you will need to include that argument again as well.

.. note::
  If you'd like to change the ``region`` of a deployment after it has already been deployed, we recommend deleting the cluster first, then redeploying the cluster with the new ``region``.

De-provisioning the cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To bring down the cluster:

.. code::

    det-deploy --delete [required args]

.. warning::
  ``determined-deploy`` will not delete active agent instances when you de-provision the cluster. Generally, the master instance will shut down any inactive agents after an idle period, but if you'd like to de-provision the cluster while these agent instances exist, you must delete all agent instances first. You can find these agent instances by filtering for instances named ``det-agent-<identifier>`` and these agent(s) will have a full name in the form ``det-agent-<identifier>-<random integer>-<version>-<pet name>``.
