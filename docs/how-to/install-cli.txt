Install Determined CLI
======================

Determined consists of several components:

-  a **master** that schedules workloads and stores metadata
-  one or more **agents** that run workloads, typically using GPUs
-  a **command-line tool** (called ``det``) that ML developers can use
   to launch new workloads and interact with Determined.

The Determined master and agents should typically be installed and configured
by a system administrator; see the :ref:`administrator install
guide <install-determined>` for more information.

Each ML developer that wants to use Determined should install a copy of the
Determined CLI on their local development machine. The CLI can be
installed via ``pip``:

.. code::

   pip install -U determined-cli

We suggest installing the CLI into a
`virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__, although this is
optional. To install the CLI into a virtualenv, first activate the
virtualenv and then type the command above.

After the CLI has been installed, it should be configured to connect to
the Determined master at the appropriate IP address. This can be accomplished
by setting the ``DET_MASTER`` environmental variable:

.. code::

   export DET_MASTER=<master IP>

You may want to place this into the appropriate configuration file for
your login shell (e.g., ``.bashrc``).

More information about using the Determined CLI can be found with the command
``det --help``.
