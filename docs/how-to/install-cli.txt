 Install Determined CLI
########################

Determined includes a **command-line tool** called ``det`` that ML
engineers can use to launch new workloads and interact with Determined.

Each ML engineer that wants to use Determined should install a copy of
the Determined CLI on their local development machine. The CLI can be
installed via ``pip``:

.. code::

   pip install determined

The CLI requires Python >= 3.6. We suggest installing the CLI into a
`virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__, although this is
optional. To install the CLI into a virtualenv, first activate the
virtualenv and then type the command above.

After the CLI has been installed, it should be configured to connect to
the Determined master at the appropriate IP address. This can be
accomplished by setting the ``DET_MASTER`` environment variable:

.. code::

   export DET_MASTER=<master IP>

You may want to place this into the appropriate configuration file for
your login shell (e.g., ``.bashrc``).

More information about using the Determined CLI can be found in the
:ref:`reference documentation <cli>` or by running ``det --help``.
