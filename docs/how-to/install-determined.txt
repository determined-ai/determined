How to Install Determined
=========================

This document provides general information on how to install and upgrade
a Determined cluster. Determined consists of several components,
primarily

-  a **master** that schedules workloads and stores metadata
-  one or more **agents** that run workloads, typically using GPUs

For information on these components, see :ref:`det-system-architecture`.

We also run two third-party services within each cluster:

- a `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database
- a `Hasura <https://hasura.io>`_ server

Each user should also :ref:`install the command-line tools
<install-cli>` on the systems from which they will be accessing
Determined.

Installation Methods
--------------------

We support running Determined either on existing machines (on-premise
installation) or by spinning up instances automatically in a cloud
environment (AWS or GCP).

Regardless of which installation method you choose, you will need the
information in :ref:`installation-background`.

On-premise Installations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On-premise installations are useful if you already have access to the
machines that you would like to install Determined on, whether that
means a single laptop for experimentation or a fleet of multi-GPU
servers. ``det-deploy`` is the most convenient on-premise option; once
installed, it will allow you to start a cluster by running a single
command on each machine. If you would like more control over the
process, you can instead manually manage the Docker images that
``det-deploy`` uses internally. If you are using Ubuntu, you also have
the option of installing most components of Determined using Debian
packages and running them as `systemd
<https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/>`__ services.

Cloud Installations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Determined can also be deployed to instances running in public cloud
providers such as AWS and GCP. Using Determined in the cloud allows you
to access more computational resources than you might have local access
to; Determined can also manage your cloud resources for you
automatically. To install Determined on the cloud, you can either use
``det-deploy``, which automates much of this process, or install and
configure Determined manually.
