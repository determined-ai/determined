 Hyperparameter Tuning
#######################

Determined provides state-of-the-art hyperparameter tuning through an intuitive interface. The
machine learning engineer simply runs an experiment in which they:

#. Configure hyperparameter ranges to search.
#. Instrument model code to use hyperparameters from the experiment configuration.
#. Specify a searcher to find effective hyperparameter settings within the predefined ranges.

***********************************
 Configuring Hyperparameter Ranges
***********************************

The first step toward automatic hyperparameter tuning is to define the hyperparameter space, e.g.,
by :ref:`listing the decisions <topic-guides_hp-tuning-basics-example-hyperparameters>` that may
impact model performance. For each hyperparameter in the search space, the machine learning engineer
specifies a range of possible values in the experiment configuration:

.. code:: yaml

   hyperparameters:
     ...
     dropout_probability:
       type: double
       minval: 0.2
       maxval: 0.5
     ...

Determined supports the following searchable hyperparameter data types:

#. ``int``: an integer within a range
#. ``double``: a floating point number within a range
#. ``log``: a logarithmically scaled floating point number---users specify a ``base`` and Determined
   searches the space of `exponents` within a range
#. ``categorical``: a variable that can take on a value within a specified set of values---the
   values themselves can be of any type

The :ref:`experiment configuration reference <experiment-configuration_hyperparameters>` details
these data types and their associated options.

**************************
 Instrumenting Model Code
**************************

Determined injects hyperparameters from the experiment configuration into model code via a context
object in the Trial base class. This :class:`~determined.TrialContext` object exposes a
:func:`~determined.TrialContext.get_hparam` method that takes the hyperparameter name. At trial
runtime, Determined injects a value for the hyperparameter. For example, to inject the value of the
``dropout_probability`` hyperparameter defined above into the constructor of a PyTorch `Dropout
<https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#dropout>`_ layer:

.. code:: python

   nn.Dropout(p=self.context.get_hparam("dropout_probability"))

To see hyperparameter injection throughout a complete Trial implementation, refer to the
:ref:`pytorch-mnist-tutorial`.

*********************************
 Specifying the Search Algorithm
*********************************

Determined supports a :ref:`variety of hyperparameter search algorithms
<topic-guides_hp-tuning-det>`. Aside from the ``single`` searcher, a searcher runs multiple trials
and decides the hyperparameter values to use in each trial. Every searcher is configured with the
name of the validation metric to optimize (via the ``metric`` field), in addition to other
searcher-specific options. For example, the (`state-of-the-art
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05934.pdf>`_) ``adaptive_asha`` searcher, suitable for larger
experiments with many trials, is configured with the maximum number of trials to run, the maximum
training length allowed per trial, and the maximum number of trials that can be worked on
simultaneously:

.. code:: yaml

   searcher:
     name: "adaptive_asha"
     metric: "validation_loss"
     max_trials: 16
     max_length:
         epochs: 1
     max_concurrent_trials: 8

For details on the supported searchers and their respective configuration options, refer to
:ref:`topic-guides_hp-tuning-det`.

That's it! After submitting an experiment, users can easily see the best validation metric observed
across all trials over time in the WebUI. After the experiment has completed, they can view the
hyperparameter values for the best-performing trials and then export the associated model
checkpoints for downstream serving.
