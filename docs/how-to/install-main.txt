How to Install Determined
=========================

Two main components are required to use Determined:
:ref:`Determined CLI <install-cli>` and a :ref:`Determined cluster <install-cluster>`.
All users should install the Determined CLI on their local development machine. The Determined
cluster should be installed in your training environment.


Install the Determined CLI
----------------------------

The Determined CLI is a command line tool that allows you to launch new
experiments and interact with a Determined cluster. To install the CLI,
refer to the :ref:`installation instructions <install-cli>`.


.. _install-cluster:

Install a Determined Cluster
-----------------------------

A :ref:`Determined cluster <install-cluster>` comprises a
:ref:`master and one or more agents <det-system-architecture>`. A
Determined cluster can be installed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google
Cloud Platform (GCP), an on-premise cluster, or on a local development
machine.

On-premise Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On-premise deployments are useful if you already have access to the
machines that you would like to install Determined on, whether that
means a single laptop for experimentation or a fleet of multi-GPU
servers.

``det-deploy`` is the most convenient on-premise option; once
installed, it will allow you to start a cluster by running a single
command on each machine. If you would like more control over the
process, you can instead manually manage the Docker images that
``det-deploy`` uses internally. If you are using Ubuntu, you also have
the option of installing most components of Determined using Debian
packages and running them as `systemd
<https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/>`__ services.

To install Determined on-premise, first :ref:`install Docker <install-docker>`.
Then install Determined by your preferred method:

   :titlesonly:

   installation/deploy
   installation/docker
   installation/packages


Cloud Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Determined can also be deployed to instances running in public cloud
providers such as AWS and GCP. Using Determined in the cloud allows you
to access more computational resources than you might have local access
to; Determined can also manage your cloud resources for you
automatically.

To install on the cloud, please follow the instructions for your preferred cloud vendor:

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   installation/aws
   installation/gcp

Notes
~~~~~

Each Determined cluster requires one third-party services, `PostgreSQL
<https://www.postgresql.org/>`_. In addition, Determined can use
`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ to run the master and agents.
Depending on your installation method, some of these services will
be installed for you:

- On a cloud provider using ``det-deploy``, the third-party services will be installed for you.
- On-premise using ``det-deploy``, Docker will need to be installed.
- When doing a manual installation, you will have to install each service yourself.
