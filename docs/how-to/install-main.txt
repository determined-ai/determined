 How to Install Determined
###########################

Two main components are required to use Determined: the :ref:`Determined
CLI <install-cli>` and a :ref:`Determined cluster <install-cluster>`.
All users should install the Determined CLI on their local development
machine. The Determined cluster should be installed in your training
environment, which might be your local development machine, an
on-premise GPU cluster, or resources in the cloud.

****************************
 Install the Determined CLI
****************************

The Determined CLI is a command line tool that allows you to launch new
experiments and interact with a Determined cluster. To install the CLI,
refer to the :ref:`installation instructions <install-cli>`.

.. _install-cluster:

******************************
 Install a Determined Cluster
******************************

A :ref:`Determined cluster <install-cluster>` comprises a :ref:`master
and one or more agents <det-system-architecture>`. A Determined cluster
can be installed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform
(GCP), an on-premise cluster, or on a local development machine.

On-premise Deployments
======================

On-premise deployments are useful if you already have access to the
machines that you would like to install Determined on, whether that
means a single laptop for local development or a fleet of multi-GPU
servers.

``det deploy`` is the most convenient on-premise option; once installed,
it will allow you to start a cluster by running a single command on each
machine. If you would like more control over the process, you can
instead manually manage the Docker images that ``det deploy`` uses
internally. If you are using Ubuntu, you also have the option of
installing most components of Determined using Debian packages and
running them as `systemd
<https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/>`__ services.

To install Determined on-premise, first :ref:`install Docker
<install-docker>`. Then install Determined by your preferred method:

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   installation/deploy
   installation/docker
   installation/linux-packages

Cloud Deployments
=================

Determined can also be deployed to instances running in public cloud
providers such as AWS and GCP. Using Determined in the cloud allows you
to access more computational resources than you might have local access
to; Determined can also manage your cloud resources for you
automatically.

To install on the cloud, please follow the instructions for your
preferred cloud vendor:

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   installation/aws
   installation/gcp

Kubernetes
==========

Determined can also be deployed onto Kubernetes clusters. To install on
Kubernetes, please follow the :ref:`Determined on Kubernetes
<install-on-kubernetes>` installation instructions.

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   installation/kubernetes
   installation/setup-gke-cluster
   installation/setup-eks-cluster

Notes
=====

You can control the behavior of the Determined master and agent by
editing configuration files. See :ref:`cluster-configuration` for
details.

Each Determined cluster requires access to a `PostgreSQL
<https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database. In addition, Determined can
use `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ to run the master and agents.
Depending on your installation method, some of these services will be
installed for you:

-  On a cloud provider using ``det deploy``, Docker and PostgreSQL will
   be installed for you.
-  On-premise using ``det deploy``, Docker will need to be installed.
-  When doing a manual installation, you will have to install Docker and
   PostgreSQL yourself.
