Saving and Restoring Notebook State
===================================

.. warning::
  It is only possible to save and restore notebook state on Determined clusters that
  are configured with a shared filesystem available to all agents.

To ensure that your work is saved even if your notebook gets terminated,
it is recommended to launch all notebooks with a shared filesystem
directory *bind-mounted* into the notebook container and work on files
inside of the bind mounted directory. For example, a user ``jimmy`` with
a shared filesystem home directory at ``/shared/home/jimmy`` could use
the following configuration to launch a notebook:

.. code::

   $ cat > config.yaml << EOL
   bind_mounts:
     - host_path: /shared/home/jimmy
       container_path: /shared/home/jimmy
   EOL
   $ det notebook start --config-file config.yaml

Working on a notebook file within the shared bind mounted directory will
ensure that your code and Jupyter checkpoints are saved on the shared
filesystem rather than an ephemeral container filesystem. If your
notebook gets terminated, launching another notebook and loading the
previous notebook file will effectively restore the session of your
previous notebook. To restore the *full* notebook state (in addition to
code), you can use Jupyter's ``File`` > ``Revert to Checkpoint``
functionality.

.. note::
  By default, JupyterLab will take a checkpoint every 120 seconds in an
  ``.ipynb_checkpoints`` folder in the same directory as the notebook file. To
  modify this setting, click on ``Settings`` > ``Advanced Settings Editor`` and
  change the value of ``"autosaveInternal"`` under ``Document Manager``.
