TensorBoard
===========

`TensorBoard <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard>`__ is a widely
used tool for visualizing and inspecting deep learning models. Determined
makes it easy to use TensorBoard to examine a single experiment or to
compare multiple experiments.

TensorBoard instances can be launched via the WebUI or the CLI. To
launch TensorBoard instances from the CLI, first :ref:`install the CLI
<install-cli>` on your development machine.

Analyzing Experiments
---------------------

To launch TensorBoard to analyze a single Determined experiment, use
``det tensorboard start <experiment-id>``:

.. code::

   $ det tensorboard start 7
   Scheduling TensorBoard (rarely-cute-man) (id: aab49ba5-3357-4145-861c-7e6ff2d702c5)...
   TensorBoard (rarely-cute-man) was assigned to an agent...
   Scheduling tensorboard tensorboard (id: c68c9fc9-7eed-475b-a50f-fd78406d7c83)...
   TensorBoard is running at: http://localhost:8080/proxy/c68c9fc9-7eed-475b-a50f-fd78406d7c83/
   disconnecting websocket

The Determined master will schedule a TensorBoard instance in the cluster. The
Determined CLI will wait until the TensorBoard instance is running, and then it
will open the TensorBoard web interface in a local browser window.

You view information about scheduled and running TensorBoard instances by
executing the following command:

.. code::

   $ det tensorboard list
    Id                                   | Owner      | Description                         | State      | Experiment Id   | Trial Ids   | Exit Status
   --------------------------------------+------------+-------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------
    aab49ba5-3357-4145-861c-7e6ff2d702c5 | determined | TensorBoard (rarely-cute-man)       | RUNNING    | 7               | N/A         | N/A

TensorBoard can also be used to analyze multiple experiments. To launch
TensorBoard for multiple experiments use
``det tensorboard start <experiment-id> <experiment-id> ...``.

.. note::
  Initially, TensorBoard may not contain metrics when the browser window opens.
  Data will be available after a trial workload is completed. TensorBoard pulls
  metrics from persistent storage. It may take up to 5 minutes for TensorBoard
  to receive data and render visualizations.

Analyzing Specific Trials
-------------------------

Determined also supports using TensorBoard to analyze specific trials from one
or more experiments. This can be useful if an experiment has many trials
but you would like to only compare a small number of them. This capability
can also be used to compare trials from *different* experiments.

To launch TensorBoard to analyze specific trials, use
``det tensorboard start --trial-ids <trial_id 1> <trial_id 2> ...``.

.. _data-in-tensorboard:

Data in TensorBoard
-------------------

In this section, we summarize how Determined captures data from TensorFlow
models. For a more in depth discussion of how TensorBoard visualizes
data see the `TensorBoard
documentation <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/README.md>`__.

TensorBoard visualizes data captured during model training and validation. Data is
captured in tfevent files by writing `TensorFlow summary
operations <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/summary>`__ to
disk via a
`tf.summary.FileWriter <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/summary/FileWriter>`__.
We provide support in each deep learning framework to write and upload
metrics as tfevent files. See below for details on how to configure
Determined with TensorBoard for your desired framework.

FileWriters are configured to write log files, called tfevent files, to
a directory known as the ``logdir``. TensorBoard watches this directory
for changes and updates accordingly. The Determined-supported ``logdir`` is
``/tmp/tensorboard``. All tfevent files written to ``/tmp/tensorboard``
in a trial are uploaded to persistent storage when a trial is
configured with Determined TensorBoard support.

Determined Batch Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the end of every training workload, batch metrics are collected and stored in
the database, providing a granular view of model metrics over time.
Batch metrics will appear in TensorBoard under the Determined group. The
x-axis of each plot corresponds to the batch number. For example, a point
at step 5 of the plot is the metric associated with the fifth batch
seen.

Framework-specific Configuration
--------------------------------

The following examples demonstrate how to configure TensorBoard for each
framework.

TensorFlow Keras
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add TensorBoard support for models that use :class:`~determined.keras.TFKerasTrial`,
add a :class:`~determined.keras.TFKerasTensorBoard` callback to your
trial class:

.. code:: python

   from determined.keras import TFKerasTensorBoard, TFKerasTrial

   class MyModel(TFKerasTrial):
       ...
       def keras_callbacks(self):
           return [TFKerasTensorBoard()]

Estimator
~~~~~~~~~

There is no configuration necessary for trials using :class:`~determined.estimator.EstimatorTrial`.
Unless configured otherwise, Estimators automatically log TensorBoard events to the ``model_dir``,
which Determined then moves to ``/tmp/tensorboard``.

Tensorpack
~~~~~~~~~~

To add TensorBoard support for models that use :ref:`Tensorpack <tensorpack>`,
add a :class:`~determined.tensorpack.TFEventWriter` callback to your trial:

.. code:: python

   from determined.tensorpack import TensorpackTrial, TFEventWriter

   class MyModel(TensorpackTrial):
       ...
       def tensorpack_monitors(self):
           return [TFEventWriter()]

PyTorch
~~~~~~~

To add TensorBoard support for models that use :ref:`PyTorch <pytorch-trial>`,
use the ``writer`` field in an instance of the
:class:`~determined.tensorboard.metric_writers.pytorch.TorchWriter` class:

.. code:: python

    from determined.tensorboard.metric_writers.pytorch import TorchWriter

    class MyModel(PyTorchTrial):
        def __init__(self, context):
            ...
            self.logger = TorchWriter()

        def train_batch(self, batch, epoch_idx, batch_idx):
            self.logger.writer.add_scalar('my_metric', np.random.random(), batch_idx)

For a full-length example of using TensorBoard with PyTorch, see the
:download:`mnist-GAN model </examples/mnist_gan_pytorch.tgz>`.

Lifecycle Management
--------------------

Determined will automatically terminate idle TensorBoard instances. A
TensorBoard instance is considered idle if it is does not receive HTTP
traffic (a TensorBoard that is still being viewed by a web browser will not be
considered idle). By default, idle TensorBoards will be terminated after 5 minutes; the
timeout duration can be changed by editing ``tensorboard_timeout`` in the
:ref:`master config file <master-configuration>`.

You can also terminate TensorBoard instances by hand using ``det tensorboard
kill <tensorboard-id>``:

.. code::

   $ det tensorboard kill aab49ba5-3357-4145-861c-7e6ff2d702c5

To open a web browser window connected to a previously launched
TensorBoard instance, use ``det tensorboard open``. To view the logs of
an existing TensorBoard instance, use ``det tensorboard logs``.

Implementation Details
----------------------

Determined schedules TensorBoard instances in containers that run on agent
machines. The Determined master will proxy HTTP requests to and from the
TensorBoard container. TensorBoard instances are hosted on agent machines but
they do not occupy GPUs.
