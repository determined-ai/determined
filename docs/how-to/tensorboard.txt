 TensorBoard
#############

`TensorBoard <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard>`__ is a widely
used tool for visualizing and inspecting deep learning models.
Determined makes it easy to use TensorBoard to examine a single
experiment or to compare multiple experiments.

TensorBoard instances can be launched via the WebUI or the CLI. To
launch TensorBoard instances from the CLI, first :ref:`install the CLI
<install-cli>` on your development machine.

***********************
 Analyzing Experiments
***********************

To launch TensorBoard to analyze a single Determined experiment, use
``det tensorboard start <experiment-id>``:

.. code::

   $ det tensorboard start 7
   Scheduling TensorBoard (rarely-cute-man) (id: aab49ba5-3357-4145-861c-7e6ff2d702c5)...
   TensorBoard (rarely-cute-man) was assigned to an agent...
   Scheduling tensorboard tensorboard (id: c68c9fc9-7eed-475b-a50f-fd78406d7c83)...
   TensorBoard is running at: http://localhost:8080/proxy/c68c9fc9-7eed-475b-a50f-fd78406d7c83/
   disconnecting websocket

The Determined master will schedule a TensorBoard instance in the
cluster. The Determined CLI will wait until the TensorBoard instance is
running, and then it will open the TensorBoard web interface in a local
browser window.

You view information about scheduled and running TensorBoard instances
by executing the following command:

.. code::

   $ det tensorboard list
    Id                                   | Owner      | Description                         | State      | Experiment Id   | Trial Ids   | Exit Status
   --------------------------------------+------------+-------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+-------------+--------------
    aab49ba5-3357-4145-861c-7e6ff2d702c5 | determined | TensorBoard (rarely-cute-man)       | RUNNING    | 7               | N/A         | N/A

TensorBoard can also be used to analyze multiple experiments. To launch
TensorBoard for multiple experiments use ``det tensorboard start
<experiment-id> <experiment-id> ...``.

.. note::

   Initially, TensorBoard may not contain metrics when the browser
   window opens. Data will be available after a trial workload is
   completed. TensorBoard pulls metrics from persistent storage. It may
   take up to 5 minutes for TensorBoard to receive data and render
   visualizations.

**************************
 Customizing TensorBoards
**************************

Determined supports initializing TensorBoard with a YAML configuration
file. For example, this feature can be useful for running TensorBoard
with a specific container image or for enabling access to additional
data with a bind-mount.

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     image: determinedai/environments:cuda-11.0-pytorch-1.7-lightning-1.2-tf-2.4-gpu-0.12.0
   bind_mounts:
     - host_path: /my/agent/path
       container_path: /my/container/path
       read_only: true

Details of configuration settings can be found in the
:ref:`command-notebook-configuration`.

To launch Tensorboard with a config file, use ``det tensorboard start
<experiment-id> --config-file=my_config.yaml``.

To view the configuration of a running Tensorboard instance, use ``det
tensorboard config <tensorboard_id>``.

***************************
 Analyzing Specific Trials
***************************

Determined also supports using TensorBoard to analyze specific trials
from one or more experiments. This can be useful if an experiment has
many trials but you would like to only compare a small number of them.
This capability can also be used to compare trials from *different*
experiments.

To launch TensorBoard to analyze specific trials, use ``det tensorboard
start --trial-ids <trial_id 1> <trial_id 2> ...``.

.. _data-in-tensorboard:

*********************
 Data in TensorBoard
*********************

In this section, we summarize how Determined captures data from
TensorFlow models. For a more in depth discussion of how TensorBoard
visualizes data see the `TensorBoard documentation
<https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/README.md>`__.

TensorBoard visualizes data captured during model training and
validation. Data is captured in tfevent files by writing `TensorFlow
summary operations
<https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/summary>`__ to disk via a
`tf.summary.FileWriter
<https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/summary/FileWriter>`__.
We provide support in each deep learning framework to write and upload
metrics as tfevent files. See below for details on how to configure
Determined with TensorBoard for your desired framework.

FileWriters are configured to write log files, called tfevent files, to
a directory known as the ``logdir``. TensorBoard watches this directory
for changes and updates accordingly. The Determined-supported ``logdir``
is ``/tmp/tensorboard``. All tfevent files written to
``/tmp/tensorboard`` in a trial are uploaded to persistent storage when
a trial is configured with Determined TensorBoard support.

Determined Batch Metrics
========================

At the end of every training workload, batch metrics are collected and
stored in the database, providing a granular view of model metrics over
time. Batch metrics will appear in TensorBoard under the Determined
group. The x-axis of each plot corresponds to the batch number. For
example, a point at step 5 of the plot is the metric associated with the
fifth batch seen.

**********************************
 Framework-specific Configuration
**********************************

The following examples demonstrate how to configure TensorBoard for each
framework.

TensorFlow Keras
================

To add TensorBoard support for models that use
:class:`~determined.keras.TFKerasTrial`, add a
:class:`determined.keras.callabacks.TensorBoard` callback to your trial
class:

.. code:: python

   from determined.keras import TFKerasTrial
   from determined.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard


   class MyModel(TFKerasTrial):
       ...

       def keras_callbacks(self):
           return [TensorBoard()]

Estimator
=========

There is no configuration necessary for trials using
:class:`~determined.estimator.EstimatorTrial`. Unless configured
otherwise, Estimators automatically log TensorBoard events to the
``model_dir``, which Determined then moves to ``/tmp/tensorboard``.

PyTorch
=======

To add TensorBoard support for models that use :ref:`PyTorch
<pytorch-trial>`, use the ``writer`` field in an instance of the
:class:`~determined.tensorboard.metric_writers.pytorch.TorchWriter`
class:

.. code:: python

   from determined.tensorboard.metric_writers.pytorch import TorchWriter


   class MyModel(PyTorchTrial):
       def __init__(self, context):
           ...
           self.logger = TorchWriter()

       def train_batch(self, batch, epoch_idx, batch_idx):
           self.logger.writer.add_scalar("my_metric", np.random.random(), batch_idx)

For a full-length example of using TensorBoard with PyTorch, see the
:download:`mnist-GAN model </examples/gan_mnist_pytorch.tgz>`.

**********************
 Lifecycle Management
**********************

Determined will automatically terminate idle TensorBoard instances. A
TensorBoard instance is considered idle if it is does not receive HTTP
traffic (a TensorBoard that is still being viewed by a web browser will
not be considered idle). By default, idle TensorBoards will be
terminated after 5 minutes; the timeout duration can be changed by
editing ``tensorboard_timeout`` in the :ref:`master config file
<master-configuration>`.

You can also terminate TensorBoard instances by hand using ``det
tensorboard kill <tensorboard-id>``:

.. code::

   $ det tensorboard kill aab49ba5-3357-4145-861c-7e6ff2d702c5

To open a web browser window connected to a previously launched
TensorBoard instance, use ``det tensorboard open``. To view the logs of
an existing TensorBoard instance, use ``det tensorboard logs``.

************************
 Implementation Details
************************

Determined schedules TensorBoard instances in containers that run on
agent machines. The Determined master will proxy HTTP requests to and
from the TensorBoard container. TensorBoard instances are hosted on
agent machines but they do not occupy GPUs.
