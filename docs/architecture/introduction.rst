 Features

Interactive Job Configuration
=============================

The behavior of interactive jobs, such as :ref:`TensorBoards <tensorboards>`, :ref:`notebooks
<notebooks>`, :ref:`commands, and shells <commands-and-shells>`, can be influenced by setting a
variety of configuration variables. These configuration variables are similar but not identical to
the configuration options supported by :ref:`experiments <experiment-config-reference>`.

Configuration settings can be specified by passing a YAML configuration file when launching the
workload via the Determined CLI.

Configuration variables can also be set directly on the command line when any Determined task,
except a TensorBoard, is launched.

Options set via ``--config`` take precedence over values specified in the configuration file.
Configuration settings are compatible with any Determined task unless otherwise specified.

Determined CLI
==============

One of the key components of the Determined platform is the :ref:`command-line interface (CLI)
<cli-ug>`. The CLI serves as a primary entry point for interacting with Determined, providing a way
to efficiently manage and control various aspects of the system. The following list describes some
of the tasks you can perform with the Determined CLI:

-  Experiment management: Running experiments is a fundamental part of the machine learning process.
   With the CLI, you can effortlessly create, list, and manage experiments, as well as access
   important experiment metrics and logs.

-  Queue management: The CLI enables users to manage their job queues, monitor the progress of
   ongoing tasks, and even prioritize or cancel jobs as needed.

-  Notebook management: Jupyter notebooks are an essential tool for data scientists and machine
   learning engineers. The CLI simplifies the process of creating, launching, and managing Jupyter
   notebooks within the platform.

-  TensorBoard integration: TensorBoard is a popular visualization tool for TensorFlow projects. The
   CLI allows users to easily launch and manage TensorBoard instances, making it simple to visualize
   and analyze the training progress of their models.

Commands and Shells
===================

In addition to structured model training workloads, which are handled using :ref:`experiments
<experiments>`, Determined also supports more free-form tasks using :ref:`commands and shells
<commands-and-shells>`.

Commands execute a user-specified program on the cluster. Shells start SSH servers that allow using
cluster resources interactively.

Commands and shells enable developers to use a Determined cluster and its GPUs without having to
write code conforming to the trial APIs. Commands are useful for running existing code in a batch
manner; shells provide access to the cluster in the form of interactive `SSH
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)>`_ sessions.

Configuration Templates
=======================

At a typical organization, many Determined configuration files will contain similar settings. For
example, all of the training workloads run at a given organization might use the same checkpoint
storage configuration. One way to reduce this redundancy is to use *configuration templates*. With
this feature, you can move settings that are shared by many experiments into a single YAML file that
can then be referenced by configurations that require those settings.

Each configuration template has a unique name and is stored by the Determined master. If a
configuration specifies a template, the effective configuration of the task will be the result of
merging the two YAML files (configuration file and template). The semantics of this merge operation
is described under :ref:`Configuration Templates: Merge Behavior <config-templates-merge-behavior>`.
Determined stores this expanded configuration so that future changes to a template will not affect
the reproducibility of experiments that used a previous version of the configuration template.

A single configuration file can use at most one configuration template. A configuration template
cannot use another configuration template.

Queue Management
================

The Determined Queue Management system extends scheduler functionality to offer better visibility
and control over scheduling decisions. It does this using the Job Queue, which provides better
information about job ordering, such as which jobs are queued, and permits dynamic job modification.

Queue Management is a new feature that is available to the fair share scheduler and the priority
scheduler. Queue Management, described in detail in the following sections, shows all submitted jobs
and their states and lets you modify some configuration options, such as priority, position in the
queue, and resource pool.

To begin managing job queues, navigate to the WebUI ``Job Queue`` section or use the ``det job`` set
of CLI commands.

Model Registry
==============

The Model Registry is a way to group conceptually related checkpoints (including ones across
different experiments), store metadata and long-form notes about a model, and retrieve the latest
version of a model for use or further development. The Model Registry can be accessed through the
WebUI, Python SDK, REST API, or CLI, though the WebUI has some features that the others are missing.

The Model Registry is a top-level option in the navigation bar. This will take you to a page listing
all of the models that currently exist in the registry, and allow you to create new models. You can
select any of the existing models to go to the Model Details page, where you can view and edit
detailed information about the model. There will also be a list of every version associated with the
selected model, and you can go to the Version Details page to view and edit that version's
information.

For more information about how to use the model registry, see `Organizing Models in the Model
Registry <../post-training/model-registry.html>`_

Notebooks
=========

`Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`__ are a convenient way to develop and debug machine
learning models, visualize the behavior of trained models, or even manage the training lifecycle of
a model manually. Determined makes it easy to launch and manage notebooks.

Determined Notebooks have the following benefits:

-  Jupyter Notebooks run in containerized environments on the cluster. We can easily manage
   dependencies using images and virtual environments. The HTTP requests are passed through the
   master proxy from and to the container.

-  Jupyter Notebooks are automatically terminated if they are idle for a configurable duration to
   release resources. A notebook instance is considered to be idle if it is not receiving any HTTP
   traffic and it is not otherwise active (as defined by the ``notebook_idle_type`` option in the
   :ref:`task configuration <command-notebook-configuration>`).

.. note::

   -  Once a Notebook is terminated, it is not possible to restore the files that are not stored in
      the persistent directories. **You need to ensure that the cluster is configured to mount
      persistent directories into the container and save files in the persistent directories in the
      container.** See :ref:`notebook-state` for more information.

   -  If you open a Notebook tab in JupyterLab, it will automatically open a kernel that will not be
      shut down automatically so you need to manually terminate the kernels.

TensorBoards
============

`TensorBoard <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard>`__ is a widely used tool for visualizing and
inspecting deep learning models. Determined makes it easy to use TensorBoard to examine a single
experiment or to compare multiple experiments.

TensorBoard instances can be launched via the WebUI or the CLI. To launch TensorBoard instances from
the CLI, first :ref:`install the CLI <install-cli>` on your development machine.

Determined is a deep learning training platform that simplifies infrastructure management for domain
experts while enabling configuration-based deep learning functionality that engineering-oriented
practitioners might find inconvenient to implement. The Determined cohesive, end-to-end training

 Concepts
**********

.. _elastic-infrastructure:

Elastic Infrastructure
======================

When running in a cloud environment, Determined can automatically provision and terminate GPU
instances as the set of deep learning workloads on the cluster changes. This capability is called
*elastic infrastructure*. The agents that are provisioned by the system are called *dynamic agents*.

The diagram below outlines the high-level system architecture when using dynamic agents:

.. image:: /assets/images/det-arch-elastic-infra.png
   :alt: Determined AI system architecture when using dynamic agents

Following the diagram, the execution would be:

#. The master collects information on idle agents (agents with no active workloads) and pending
   workloads (agents waiting to be scheduled).

#. The master calculates the ideal size of the cluster and decides how many agents to launch and
   which agents to terminate. The calculation is done based on the configured scaling behavior and
   the specification of the resource pools.

   -  An agent that is not running any containers is considered *idle*. By default, idle dynamic
      agents will automatically be terminated after 5 minutes of inactivity. This behavior gives
      agents a chance to run multiple workloads after they have been provisioned.

#. The master makes API calls to agent providers, such as AWS and GCP, to provision and terminate
   agents as necessary.

#. Once the agent instance has been created, it will automatically connect to the current master.
   The time it takes to create a new instance depends on the cloud provider and the configured
   instance type, but >60 seconds is typical.

Experiment
==========

An *experiment* represents the basic unit of running the model training code. An experiment is a
collection of one or more trials that are exploring a user-defined hyperparameter space. For
example, during a learning rate hyperparameter search, an experiment might consist of three trials
with learning rates of .001, .01, and .1.

To run experiments, you need to write your model training code. A *model definition* represents a
specification of a deep learning model and its training procedure. It contains training code that
implements training APIs. Visit the :doc:`Training API Guides
</model-dev-guide/apis-howto/overview>` for more information.

For each experiment, you can configure a *searcher*, also known as a *search algorithm*. The search
algorithm determines how many trials will be run for a particular experiment and how the
hyperparameters will be set. More information can be found at
:doc:`/model-dev-guide/hyperparameter/overview`.

.. _resource-pools:

Resource Pools
==============

To run tasks such as experiments or notebooks, Determined needs to have resources (CPUs, GPUs) on
which to run the tasks. However, different tasks have different resource requirements and, given the
cost of GPU resources, it is important to choose the right resources for specific goals so that you
get the most value out of your money. For example, you may want to run your training on beefy V100
GPU machines, while you want your TensorBoards to run on cheap CPU machines with minimal resources.

Determined has the concept of a *resource pool*, which is a collection of identical resources that
are located physically close to each other. Determined allows you to configure your cluster to have
multiple resource pools and to assign tasks to a specific resource pool so that you can use
different sets of resources for different tasks. Each resource pool handles scheduling and instance
provisioning independently.

When you configure a cluster, you set which pool is the default for auxiliary tasks and which pool
is the default for compute tasks. CPU-only tasks such as TensorBoards will run on the default
auxiliary pool unless you specify that they should run in a different pool when launching the task.
Tasks that require a slot, such as experiments or GPU notebooks, will use the default compute pool
unless otherwise specified. For this reason it is recommended that you always create a cluster with
at least two pools, one with low-cost CPU instances for auxiliary tasks and one with GPU instances
for compute tasks. This is the default setup when launching a cluster on AWS or GCP using ``det
deploy``.

Here are some scenarios where it can be valuable to use multiple resource pools:

-  *Use GPU for training while using CPUs for TensorBoard.*

   You create one pool, ``aws-v100``, that provisions ``p3dn.24xlarge`` instances (large V100 EC2
   instances) and another pool, ``aws-cpu`` that provisions ``m5.large`` instances (small and cheap
   CPU instances). You train your experiments using the ``aws-v100`` pool, while you run your
   TensorBoards in the ``aws-cpu`` pool. When your experiments complete, the ``aws-v100 pool`` can
   scale down to zero to save money, but you can continue to run your TensorBoard. Without resource
   pools, you would have needed to keep a ``p3dn.24xlarge`` instance running to keep the TensorBoard
   alive. By default TensorBoard will always run on the default CPU pool.

-  *Use GPUs in different availability zones on AWS.*

   You have one pool ``aws-v100-us-east-1a`` that runs ``p3dn.24xlarge`` in the ``us-east-1a``
   availability zone and another pool ``aws-v100-us-east-1b`` that runs ``p3dn.24xlarge`` instances
   in the ``us-east-1b`` availability zone. You can launch an experiment into
   ``aws-v100-us-east-1a`` and, if AWS does not have sufficient ``p3dn.24xlarge`` capacity in that
   availability zone, you can launch the experiment in ``aws-v100-us-east-1b`` to check if that
   availability zone has capacity. Note that the "AWS does not have capacity" notification is only
   visible in the master logs, not on the experiment itself.

-  *Use spot/preemptible instances and fall back to on-demand if needed.*

   You have one pool ``aws-v100-spot`` that you use to try to run training on spot instances and
   another pool ``aws-v100-on-demand`` that you fall back to if AWS does not have enough spot
   capacity to run your job. Determined will not switch from spot to on-demand instances
   automatically, but by configuring resource pools appropriately, it should be easy for users to
   select the appropriate pool depending on the job they want to run and the current availability of
   spot instances in the AWS region they are using. For more information on using spot instances,
   refer to :ref:`aws-spot`.

-  *Use cheaper GPUs for prototyping on small datasets and expensive GPUs for training on full
   datasets.*

   You have one pool with less expensive GPUs that you use for initial prototyping on small data
   sets and another pool that you use for training more mature models on large datasets.

Limitations
-----------

Currently resource pools are completely independent from each other so it is not possible to launch
an experiment that tries to use one pool and then falls back to another one if a certain condition
is met. You will need to manually decide to shift an experiment from one pool to another.

A cluster is not currently allowed to have resource pools in multiple AWS/GCP regions or across
multiple cloud providers. If the master is running in one AWS/GCP region, all resource pools must
also be in that AWS/GCP region.

If you create a task that needs slots and specify a pool that will never have slots (i.e. a pool
with CPU-only instances), that task can never get scheduled. Currently that task will appear to be
PENDING permanently.

Set up Resource Pools
---------------------

Resource pools are configured using the :ref:`master configuration <master-config-reference>`. For
each resource pool, you can configure scheduler and provider information.

If you are using static resource pools and launching agents by hand, you will need to update the
:ref:`agent configuration <agent-config-reference>` to specify which resource pool the agent should
join.

Migrate to Resource Pools
-------------------------

Resource pools were introduced with Determined 0.14.0, resulting in changes to the :ref:`master
configuration <master-config-reference>` format.

Since the change is backwards-compatible, cluster configurations that use earlier formats (prior to
Determined 0.14.0) will still work. A configuration in the earlier format is interpreted as a
cluster with a single resource pool that is the default for both CPU and GPU tasks. To take full
advantage of resource pools, convert to the latest format. Converting is a simple process of moving
around and renaming a small number of top-level fields.

The earlier format had the top-level fields of ``scheduler`` and ``provisioner`` which set the
scheduler and provisioner settings for the cluster. By contrast, the latest format has the top-level
fields of ``resource_manager`` and ``resource_pools``. The ``resource_manager`` section is for
cluster level setting such as which pools should be used by default and the default scheduler
settings. The ``scheduler`` information is identical to the ``scheduler`` field in the legacy
format. The ``resource_pools`` section is a list of resource pools each of which has a name,
description and resource pool level settings. Each resource pool can be configured with a
``provider`` field that contains the same information as the ``provisioner`` field in the legacy
format. Each resource pool can also have a ``scheduler`` field that sets resource pool specific
scheduler settings. If the ``scheduler`` field is not set for a specific resource pool, the default
settings are used.

Note that defining resource pool-specific ``scheduler`` settings is all-or-nothing. If the
pool-specific ``scheduler`` field is blank, all scheduler settings will be inherited from the
settings defined in ``resource_manager.scheduler``. If any fields are set in the pool-specific
``scheduler`` section, no settings will be inherited from ``resource_manager.scheduler`` - you need
to redefine everything.

Here is an example master configuration illustrating the potential problem.

.. code:: yaml

   resource_manager:
     type: agent
     scheduler:
       type: round_robin
       fitting_policy: best
     default_aux_resource_pool: pool1
     default_compute_resource_pool: pool1

   resource_pools:
     - pool_name: pool1
       scheduler:
         fitting_policy: worst

This example sets the cluster-wide scheduler defaults to use a best-fit, round robin scheduler in
``resource_manager.scheduler``. The scheduler settings at the pool level for ``pool1`` are then
overwritten. Because ``scheduler.fitting_policy=worst`` is set, no settings are inherited from
``resource_manager.scheduler`` so pool1 uses a worst-fit, fair share scheduler because for a blank
``scheduler.type`` field, the default value is ``fair_share``.

If you want to have ``pool1`` use a worst-fit, round robin scheduler, you need to make sure you
redefine the scheduler type at the pool-specific level:

.. code:: yaml

   resource_manager:
     type: agent
     scheduler:
       type: round_robin
       fitting_policy: best
     default_aux_resource_pool: pool1
     default_compute_resource_pool: pool1

   resource_pools:
     - pool_name: pool1
       scheduler:
         type: round_robin
         fitting_policy: worst

Launch Tasks into Resource Pools
--------------------------------

When creating a task, the job configuration file has a section called "resources". You can set the
``resource_pool`` subfield to specify the ``resource_pool`` that a task should be launched into.

.. code:: yaml

   resources:
       resource_pool: pool1

If this field is not set, the task will be launched into one of the two default pools defined in the
:ref:`master configuration <master-config-reference>`. Experiments will be launched into the default
compute pool. TensorBoards will be launched into the default auxiliary pool. Commands, shells, and
notebooks that request a slot (which is the default behavior if the ``resources.slots`` field is not
set) will be launched into the default compute pool. Commands, shells, and notebooks that explicitly
request 0 slots (for example the "Launch CPU-only Notebook" button in the WebUI) will use the
auxiliary pool.

.. _scheduling:

Scheduling
==========

This document covers the supported scheduling policies. The first section describes the native
scheduling capabilities supported by Determined. The next section describes how Determined schedules
tasks when running on Kubernetes.

Native Scheduler
----------------

Administrators can configure the desired scheduler in master configuration file. It is also possible
to configure different scheduling behavior for different :ref:`resource pools <resource-pools>`.

Once the scheduling policy has been defined for the current master and/or resource pool, the
scheduling behavior of an individual task is influenced by several task configuration values:

-  For the fair-share scheduler, ``resources.weight`` lets users set the resource demand of a task
   relative to other tasks.
-  For the priority scheduler, ``resources.priority`` lets users assign a priority order to tasks.
-  Regardless of the scheduler, ``searcher.max_concurrent_trials`` lets users cap the number of
   slots that an ``adaptive_asha`` hyperparameter search experiment will request at any given time.

.. note::

   Zero-slot tasks (e.g., CPU-only notebooks, TensorBoards) are scheduled independently of tasks
   that require slots (e.g., experiments, GPU notebooks). The fair-share scheduler schedules
   zero-slot tasks on a FIFO basis. The priority scheduler schedules zero-slot tasks based on
   priority.

Fair-Share
^^^^^^^^^^

The master allocates cluster resources (*slots*) among the active experiments using a weighted
fair-share scheduling policy. Slots are divided among the active experiments according to the
*demand* (number of desired concurrent tasks) of each experiment. For instance, in an eight-GPU
cluster running two experiments with demands of ten and thirty, the scheduler assigns two slots and
six slots respectively. As new experiments become active or the resource demand of an active
experiment changes, the scheduler will adjust how slots are allocated to experiments as appropriate.

The behavior of the fair-share scheduler can be modified by changing the *weight* of a workload. A
workload demand for slots is multiplied by the workload weight for scheduling purposes. A workload
with a higher weight will be assigned proportionally more resources than a workload with lower
weight. The default weight is ``1``. For example, in the scenario above, if the weight of the first
experiment is set to 3 and the weight of the second experiment is set to 1, each experiment will be
assigned four slots.

Task Priority
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The master allocates cluster resources (*slots*) to active tasks based on their *priority*.
High-priority tasks are preferred to low-priority tasks. Low-priority tasks will be preempted to
make space for pending high-priority tasks if possible. Tasks of equal priority are scheduled in the
order in which they were created.

By default, the priority scheduler does not use preemption. If preemption is enabled in the master
configuration file, when a higher priority task is pending and cannot be scheduled because no idle
resources are available, the scheduler will attempt to schedule it by preempting lower priority
tasks, starting with the task with the lowest priority. If there are no tasks to preempt, lower
priority tasks might be backfilled on the idle resources. When a trial is preempted, its state is
checkpointed so that the progress of the trial is not lost. Enabling preemption ensures that cluster
resources can be reallocated to high priority tasks more promptly and backfilled to make the most
use of the idle resources; however, preemption can also result in additional overhead due to
checkpointing low priority tasks, which might be expensive for some models.

Notebooks, TensorBoards, shells, and commands are not preemptible. These tasks will continue to
occupy cluster resources until they complete or are terminated.

The priority of any task can be changed after it is created using one of the following commands:

.. code::

   det experiment set priority <ID> <priority>
   det command set priority <ID> <priority>
   det notebook set priority <ID> <priority>
   det shell set priority <ID> <priority>
   det tensorboard set priority <ID> <priority>

However, since only experiments are preemptible, changing the priority of any other kind of task
after it is scheduled has no effect. (It can still be useful to change the priorities of such tasks
before they are scheduled in order to affect when they ultimately start running.)

An example of priority scheduler behavior with preemption enabled:

#. User submits a priority 2 adaptive_asha experiment with max_concurrent_trials 20 and
   slots_per_trial 1. 8 trials run and utilize all 8 GPUs.

#. User submits a priority 1 distributed training experiment with slots_per_trial 4. 4 ASHA trials
   are preempted so the new distributed training experiment can run. Note that if preemption was not
   enabled, the new experiment would not get scheduled until the ASHA experiment GPU demand becomes
   <= 4.

#. User starts a priority 3 notebook with resources.slots 1. The notebook has a lower priority than
   the two active experiments, so it will run as soon as the two active experiments collectively
   need <= 7 GPUs.

#. ASHA and the distributed training experiment both complete, and the notebook task with priority 3
   will run.

#. User submits a priority 1 distributed training experiment with slots_per_trial 8. Although this
   workload has a higher priority than the active notebook task, it cannot be scheduled because it
   requires 8 slots, notebooks are not preemptible, and therefore only 7 slots are available.

#. User submits a priority 2 distributed training experiment with slots_per_trial 4. One trial will
   be scheduled to make use of the idle 7 slots.

#. The notebook is killed. The priority 2 distributed training experiment is preempted. And then the
   priority 1 distributed training experiment starts running. Once that experiment is complete,
   distributed training experiment with priority 2 restarts.

The priority scheduler can be used with the Determined job queue, which provides more insight into
scheduling decisions.

.. _scheduling-on-kubernetes:

Scheduling with Kubernetes
--------------------------

When using Determined on Kubernetes, Determined workloads, such as experiments, notebooks, and
shells, are started by launching Kubernetes pods. The scheduling behavior that applies to those
workloads depends on how the Kubernetes scheduler has been configured.

.. _gang-scheduling-on-kubernetes:

Gang Scheduling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the Kubernetes scheduler does not perform gang scheduling or support preemption of pods.
While it does take pod priority into account, it greedily schedules pods without consideration for
the job each pod belongs to. This can result in problematic behavior for deep learning workloads,
particularly for distributed training jobs that use many GPUs. A distributed training job that uses
multiple pods requires all pods to be scheduled and running in order to make progress. Because
Kubernetes does not support gang scheduling by default, cluster deadlocks can arise. For example,
suppose that two experiments are launched simultaneously that each require 16 GPUs on a cluster with
only 16 GPUs. It is possible that Kubernetes will assign some GPUs to one experiment and some GPUs
to the other. Because neither experiment will receive the resources it needs to begin executing, the
system will wait indefinitely.

One way Determined addresses these problems is through the use of the `lightweight coscheduling
plugin <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/tree/release-1.18/pkg/coscheduling>`__,
which extends the Kubernetes scheduler to support priority-based gang scheduling. To implement gang
scheduling, the coscheduling plugin will not schedule a pod unless there are enough available
resources to also schedule the rest of the pods in the same job. To function, the plugin requires
special labels to be set that specify the number of nodes that each job needs for execution.
Determined automatically calculates and sets these labels for GPU experiments that it launches.

The coscheduling plugin is in beta and is therefore not enabled by default. To enable it, edit
``values.yaml`` in the Determined Helm chart to set the ``defaultScheduler`` field to
``coscheduler``.

There are several limitations to the coscheduling plugin to be aware of:

#. The coscheduling plugin does not work with Kubernetes' cluster autoscaling feature. Static node
   pools must be used to achieve gang scheduling

#. The plugin does not support preemption. For example, if the cluster is full of low priority jobs
   and a new high priority job is submitted, the high priority job will not be scheduled until one
   of the low priority jobs finishes.

#. The Determined capability to automatically set pod labels is restricted to GPU experiments.
   Determined does not currently set labels for CPU experiments or user commands.

#. When scheduling experiments that utilize the entire cluster, the plugin may take several minutes
   to schedule the next job. Because the coscheduler only approves of jobs when all of its pods are
   available, it may repeatedly reject partially-ready jobs, causing them to wait further.

To enable gang scheduling with commands or CPU experiments, enable the coscheduler in
``values.yaml`` and modify the experiment config to contain the following:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
      pod_spec:
         metadata:
            labels:
               pod-group.scheduling.sigs.k8s.io/name: <unique task name>
               pod-group.scheduling.sigs.k8s.io/min-available: <# of GPUs required>
         spec:
            schedulerName: coscheduler

You can also use ``schedulerName: default-scheduler`` to use the default Kubernetes scheduler.

Additionally, please note that when running Determined on Kubernetes, a higher priority value means
a higher priority (e.g. a priority 50 task will run before a priority 40 task).

.. _priority-scheduling-on-kubernetes:

Priority Scheduling with Preemption
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Determined also makes available a priority scheduler that extends the Kubernetes scheduler to
support preemption with backfilling. This plugin will preempt existing pods if higher priority pods
are submitted. If there is still space in the cluster, backfilling will attempt to fill the nodes by
scheduling lower priority jobs. Additionally, if there are leftover slots on partially-filled nodes,
the scheduler will attempt to assign single-slot tasks until the space is filled. This packing
behavior only occurs with single-slot tasks.

This plugin is also in beta and is not enabled by default. To enable it, edit ``values.yaml`` in the
Determined Helm chart to set the ``defaultScheduler`` field to ``preemption``. Autoscaling is not
supported and Determined can only automatically set labels for GPU experiments.

Determined provides a default priority class, ``determined-medium-priority`` that has a priority of
``50`` and is used for all tasks. If users want to set a different priority level for an experiment,
they may either specify a priority in the ``resources`` field of the experiment config or create a
priorityClass and specify it in the ``pod_spec`` of the config. If both are specified, the specified
priorityClass will take precedence over the priority field. In Kubernetes, a higher priority value
means a higher priority (e.g. a priority 50 task will run before a priority 40 task).

Additionally, if using a cluster with tainted nodes or labels, users must specify the tolerations or
node selectors in the ``pod_spec``. It is recommended that you use both tolerations and node
selectors to better constrain where your experiments can run, especially on clusters that contain
multiple GPU types.

Below is an example that illustrates how to set priorities, tolerations, and node selectors.

.. code:: yaml

   resources:
      priority: 42 # priorityClass, if set, takes precedence over this value
   environment:
      pod_spec:
         apiVersion: v1
         kind: Pod
         spec:
            priorityClassName: determined-medium-priority # don't set if using priority value
            nodeSelector:
               key: value
            tolerations:
            -  key: "key1"
               operator: "Equal"
               value: "value"
               effect: "NoSchedule"

The Kubernetes priority scheduler can be used with the Determined job queue feature, which allows
more insight into scheduling decisions.

.. _concept-trial:

Trial
=====

A *trial* is a training task with a defined set of hyperparameters. A common degenerate case is an
experiment with a single trial, which corresponds to training a single deep learning model.

Workspaces and Projects
=======================

**Workspaces** and **projects** provide a way to organize experiments. A project is a collection of
experiments, and a workspace is a collection of projects. Learn more about workspaces and projects
at :doc:`/setup-cluster/workspaces`.

RBAC and User Groups
====================

**Role Based Access Control (RBAC)** enables administrators to control user access to various
actions and data within Determined. RBAC feature requires Determined Enterprise Edition. Learn more
about RBAC and User Group usage at :doc:`/setup-cluster/security/rbac`.

.. _topic-guides_yaml:

YAML Configuration
==================

`YAML <https://yaml.org/>`__ is a markup language often used for configuration. Determined uses YAML
for configuring tasks such as :ref:`experiments <experiment-config-reference>` and :ref:`notebooks
<notebook-configuration>`, as well as configuring the Determined :ref:`cluster as a whole
<cluster-configuration>`. This guide describes a subset of YAML that is recommended for use with
Determined. This is not a full description of YAML; see the `specification
<https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html>`__ or other online guides for more details.

YAML Types
----------

A value in YAML can be a ``null`` or number, string, or Boolean scalar, or an array or map
collection. Collections can contain other collections nested to any depth, although, the Determined
YAML files generally have a fixed structure.

A comment in a YAML file starts with a ``#`` character and extends to the end of the line.

If you are familiar with `JSON <https://www.json.org>`__, you can think of YAML as an alternative
way of expressing JSON objects that is meant to be easier for humans to read and write, since it
allows comments and has fewer markup characters around the content.

Maps
^^^^

Maps represent unordered mappings from strings to YAML values. A map is written as a sequence of
key-value pairs. Each key is followed by a colon and the corresponding value. The value can be on
the same line as the key if it is a scalar (in which case it must be preceded by a space) or on
subsequent lines (in which case it must be indented, conventionally by two spaces).

A map is used in the experiment configuration to configure hyperparameters:

.. code:: yaml

   hyperparameters:
     base_learning_rate: 0.001
     weight_cost: 0.0001
     global_batch_size: 64
     n_filters1: 40
     n_filters2: 40

The snippet above describes a map with one key, ``hyperparameters``; the corresponding value is
itself a map whose keys are ``base_learning_rate``, ``weight_cost``, etc.

Arrays
^^^^^^

An array contains multiple other YAML values in some order. An array is written as a sequence of
values, each one preceded by a hyphen and a space. The hyphens for one list must all be indented by
the same amount.

An array is used in the experiment configuration to configure environment variables:

.. code:: yaml

   environment:
     environment_variables:
       - A=A
       - B=B
       - C=C

Scalars
^^^^^^^

Scalars generally behave naturally: ``null``, ``true``, ``2.718``, and ``"foo"`` all have the same
meanings that they would in JSON (and many programming languages). However, YAML allows strings to
be unquoted: ``foo`` is the same as ``"foo"``. This behavior is often convenient, but it can lead to
unexpected behavior when small edits to a value change its type. For example, the following YAML
block represents a list containing several values whose types are listed in the comments:

.. code:: yaml

   - true          # Boolean
   - grue          # string

   - 0.0           # number
   - 0.0.          # string

   - foo: bar      # map
   - foo:bar       # string
   - foo bar       # string

Example Experiment Configuration
--------------------------------

A Determined configuration file consists of a YAML object with a particular structure: a map at the
top level that is expected to have certain keys, with the value for each key expected to have a
certain structure in turn.

In this example experiment configuration, numbers, strings, maps, and an array are demonstrated:

.. code:: yaml

   name: mnist_tf_const
   data:
     base_url: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/determined-ai-datasets/mnist/
     training_data: train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
     training_labels: train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
     validation_set_size: 10000
   hyperparameters:
     base_learning_rate: 0.001
     weight_cost: 0.0001
     global_batch_size: 64
     n_filters1: 40
     n_filters2: 40
   searcher:
     name: single
     metric: error
     max_length:
       batches: 500
     smaller_is_better: true
   environment:
     environment_variables:
       - A=A
       - B=B
       - C=C
