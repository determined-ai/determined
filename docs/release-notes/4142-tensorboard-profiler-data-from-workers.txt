**New Features**

-  TensorBoard:
      -  In TFKerasTrial, the TensorBoard profiling data from all workers is uploaded to the
         checkpoint storage.

      -  In PyTorchTrial, the same result is obtained without modifying the file names.

      -  A new argument to `core.init()`, `tensorboard_sync_mode`, controls the way files generated
         for consumption by TensorBoard are handled by workers.

      -  A new method, `TrainContext.upload_tb_files()`, copies those files to checkpoint storage
         while optionally renaming them.
