**New Features**

-  API:
      Trial API now uploads profiling data to the checkpoint storage from all workers. Core API
      users can now pass a new optional argument, `tensorboard_mode`, to `core.init()`. The default
      value is `AUTO`. In `AUTO` mode tensorboard metrics are written on the chief, and metrics as
      well as profiling data are uploaded to checkpoint storage from the chief only. In `MANUAL`
      mode the user is responsible for writing tensorboard metrics and uploading profiling data. In
      order to make that possible, two new methods are introduced on `TrainContext`:
      `get_tensorboard_path()` returns the path to the directory where metrics can be written
      `upload_tensorboard_files()` uploads metrics and other files, such as profiling data, to
      checkpoint storage.
