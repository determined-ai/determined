**New Features**

-  TensorBoard:
      A new method, `TrainContext.upload_tensorboard_files()`, copies TensorBoard profiling data
      files to checkpoint storage while optionally renaming them. It enables uploading profiling
      data from non-chief workers (TensorBoard metrics and profiling data from chief is uploaded
      automatically).
