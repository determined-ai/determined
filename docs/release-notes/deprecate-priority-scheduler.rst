**Deprecations**

Kubernetes Scheduling: Support for the priority scheduler for Kubernetes Resource Managers is
discontinued and may be removed in a future release due to limited usage. Users should transition to
the default scheduler. Visit :ref:`Kubernetes Default Scheduler <kubernetes-default-scheduler>` for
details.
