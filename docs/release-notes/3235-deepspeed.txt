**New Features**

-  Support DeepSpeed with a new DeepSpeedTrial API.

   -  `DeepSpeed <https://www.deepspeed.ai/>`_ is a powerful library for training large scale models.
         With the new ``DeepSpeedTrial`` you can combine all the benefits of Determined with the
         features available in DeepSpeed like the Zero Redundancy Optimizer and pipeline parallel
         training. We also provide an example based on Eleuther AI's `GPT-NeoX
         <https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/>`_ repo to help you get started training
         state-of-the-art language models.
