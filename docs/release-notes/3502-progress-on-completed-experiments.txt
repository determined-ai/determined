**API Changes**

-  When an experiment successfully completes, its progress value will be set to 1 instead of 0 or
   null.

-  When an experiment fails, its progress value will remain constant instead of being
      reset to 0 or null.

-  Calls to `/api/v1/experiments` or `/api/v1/experiments/:id` will allow the value
      of the `progress` field to be null instead of 0, in cases where the progress has not been
      recorded or it was reset to null.
