**API Changes**

-  When an experiment successfully completes, its progress value will be set to 1 instead of 0 or
   null.

-  Calls to `/api/v1/experiments` or `/api/v1/experiments/:id` will allow the value
      of the `progress` field to be null instead of 0 in cases where the experiment has not yet run
      or failed to complete.
