**New Features**

-  Notebooks: Add a config field ``notebook_idle_type`` that changes how the idleness of a notebook
   is determined for the idle timeout feature. If the value is different from the default, users do
   not need to manually shut down kernels to allow the idle timeout to take effect. See :ref:`the
   documentation <command-notebook-configuration>` for more information.
