**Improvements**

-  WebUI: Change the "Compute Slots Allocated" label to "Unspecified Slots Allocated" for resource
   pools with no or multiple slot types. Added error logs for zero or multi-slot-type cases, and
   updated the progress bar to include all agents when the slot type is TYPE_UNSPECIFIED.
