**New Features**

-  Add ``on_trial_startup()`` and ``on_trial_shutdown()`` methods to
   :class:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchCallback`. Whenever ``on_trial_startup()`` is called,
   ``on_trial_shutdown()`` is always called before the trial container shuts down. These callbacks
   make it possible to do reliable resource management in a training container, such as if you wish
   to start a background thread or process for data loading and shut it down before the process
   exits.
