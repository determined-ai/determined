**New Features**

-  Stopping-based Adaptive Search: This release introduces a
   stopping-based variant of `adaptive` hyperparameter search that will
   continue training trials by default unless stopped by the algorithm.
   Compared to the default promotions-based algorithm, the stopping
   variant will promote to higher rungs faster and does not require
   fault tolerance since it will not resume stopped trials.
