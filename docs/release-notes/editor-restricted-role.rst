**New Features**

-  RBAC: Add a pre-canned role called ``EditorRestricted`` which supersedes the ``Viewer`` role and
   precedes the ``Editor`` role.

   -  Like the ``Editor`` role, the ``EditorRestricted`` role grants the permissions to create,
      edit, or delete projects and experiments within its designated scope. However, the
      ``EditorRestricted`` role lacks the permissions to create or update NTSC-type workloads.

      Therefore, a user with ``EditorRestricted`` privileges in a given scope is limited when using
      the WebUI within that scope since the option to launch JupyterLab notebooks and kill running
      tasks will be unavailable. The user will also be unable to run CLI commands that create scoped
      notebooks, TensorBoards, shells, and commands and will be unable to perform updates on these
      tasks (such as changing the task's priority or deleting it). ``EditorRestricted`` users can
      still open and use scoped JupyterLab notebooks and perform all experiment-related jobs, just
      like those with the ``Editor`` role.

   -  The ``EditorRestricted`` role allows workspace and cluster editors and admins to have more
      fine-grained control over GPU resources. Thus, users with this role lack the ability to launch
      or modify tasks that indefinitely consume slot-requesting resources within a given scope.
