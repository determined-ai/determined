**New Features**

-  Add experimental support for recovering live trials on master process restart. Users can restart
   the master (with updated configuration options), or upgrade the master software version, and the
   current running trials will continue running (using the original configuration and harness
   versions). This requires agent to reconnect within a configurable ``agent_reconnect_wait``
   period. Only available for ``agent`` resource manager, and can be enabled for each resource pool
   using ``agent_reattach_enabled`` flag. May only be available for "patch" level releases.
