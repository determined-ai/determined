**New Features**

-  Trials: Add new support for profiling model code. For PyTorch, you
   can collect timings and system metrics. For all frameworks collecting
   system metrics, such as GPU util or memory, is supported. To quickly
   try it, just set `profiling.enabled = true` in your Experiment
   Configuration. For a longer introduction to the features, checkout
   the new :ref:`guide <how-to-profiling>` on how to profile models in
   Determined or view details on available configurations in the
   :ref:`reference <experiment-configuration_profiling>`
