**Features**

   -  Added resource pools, which allows for different types of tasks to
      be scheduled onto different types of agents. For more information
      see :ref:`resource-pools`.

   -  ``det-deploy`` will now create clusters with two resource pools,
      one that uses GPU instances and one that uses CPU instances for
      tasks that only require CPUs.
