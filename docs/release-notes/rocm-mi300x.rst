**New Features**

-  Added New ROCM 6.1 images with deepspeed for MI300x users. Dev versions of these images can be
   found in our dockerhub, under `pytorch-infinityhub-dev
   <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/determinedai/pytorch-infinityhub-dev/tags>`__ and
   `pytorch-infinityhub-hpc-dev
   <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/determinedai/pytorch-infinityhub-hpc-dev/tags>`__.
   Users can build these images locally based on the dockerfiles found in our `environments
   repository
   <https://github.com/determined-ai/environments/blob/main/Dockerfile-infinityhub-pytorch>`__.
