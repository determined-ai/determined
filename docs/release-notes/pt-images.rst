**New Features**

*  Container Images: Add maintained images for PyTorch-only environments.

   *  Current environment images contain both PyTorch and TensorFlow which
	  results in large image sizes. Adding a class of images for users who
	  do not require TensorFlow but may still require TensorBoard.
