**Improvements**

-  Use one TCP port for all incoming connections to the master and use
   TLS for all connections if configured.

   -  **BREAKING CHANGE:** The ``http_port`` and ``https_port`` options
      in the master configuration have been replaced by the single
      ``port`` option. The ``security.http`` option is no longer
      accepted; the master can no longer be configured to listen over
      HTTP and HTTPS simultaneously.
