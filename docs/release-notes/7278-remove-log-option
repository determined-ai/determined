**Deprecated Features**

-  API: The ``SummarizeTrial`` endpoint is removed in favor of ``CompareTrials``; send a similar request with the `trial_id` parameter replaced by the `trial_ids` array.

-  API: The ``scale`` parameter is removed from ``CompareTrialsRequest``; this was used only for lttb downsampling which has since been replaced.
