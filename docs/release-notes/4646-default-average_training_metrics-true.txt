**Breaking Changes**

-  Experiment: the ``average_training_metrics`` experiment configuration default has been changed to
   ``True``.  This change only affects distributed training.  The previous default of ``False``
   leads to only the chief worker's training metrics being reported. Setting this configuration to
   ``True`` instead reports the true average of all workers' training metrics at the cost of
   increased communication overhead.  Users who do not require accurate training metrics may
   explicitly revert this configuration to ``False`` as an optimization.
