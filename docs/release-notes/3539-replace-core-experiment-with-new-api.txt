**Breaking Changes**

-  Master: removes endpoints (/:experiment_id, /:experiment_id/checkpoints, /:experiment_id/config,
   /:experiment_id/model_def, /:experiment_id/preview_gc, /:experiment_id/summary, and
   /:experiment_id/metrics/summary) from the legacy API. This data is available in the GRPC API
   (/api/v1/experiments) in the Web UI, CLI, and tests.

-  Master: removed two endpoints (/:trial_id/details, /:trial_id/metrics) from the legacy API. This
   data is available in the GRPC API (/api/v1/experiments/:experiment_id/trials,
   /api/v1/experiments/:experiment_id/checkpoints, and /api/v1/trials).
