**New Features**

-  Support configuring working directory in the ``work_dir`` field for commands, shells, and
   Notebooks. You can also optionally set it in the `task_container_defaults.work_dir` field of the
   master configuration. The value set in the master configuration will be ignored if submitting a
   context directory.
