**New Feature**

-  Cluster: Add support for experiment tag propagation.

   -  The enterprise edition of [HPE Machine Learning Development Environment]
      (https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning-development-environment.html)
      now allows for experiment tags to be propagated as labels to the associated jobs on the HPC
      cluster. A number of labelling schemes are supported, controlled by the configuration item
      ``resource_manager.job_project_source``.
