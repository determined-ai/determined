**New Features**

- Cluster: Determined Enterprise Edition can now be deployed on a Slurm cluster.  When using Slurm, 
  Determined delegates all job scheduling and prioritization to the Slurm workload manager. 
  This integration enables existing Slurm workloads and Determined workloads to coexist and 
  Determined workloads to access all of the advanced capabilities of the Slurm workload manager.
  The Determined Slurm integration can use either Singularity or PodMan for the container
  runtime.
