**Removed Features**

-  Python SDK: Remove the ``determined-cli``, ``determined-common``, and ``determined-deploy``
   packages, which were deprecated in 0.15.0 (April 2021). The ``determined.cli``,
   ``determined.common``, and ``determined.deploy`` submodules of the ``determined`` package should
   be used instead.
