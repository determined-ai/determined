**New Features**

-  The ``environment.force_pull_image: true`` behavior has improved when running on Determined
   Agents. Previously, it would delete the image if it existed before re-pulling it. This behavior
   was wasteful of network resources and execution time. Now, it will pull without deleting
   anything, effectively pulling only the updated layers of the image.
