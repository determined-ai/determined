**New Features**

-  Cluster: Add resource pool to workspace mapping feature, allowing resource pools to be bound to
   specific workspaces. Bound resource pools can only be used by the workspaces they are bound to.
   When combined with RBAC, this feature restricts the resources that users can access based on the
   workspaces they have permissions to.
