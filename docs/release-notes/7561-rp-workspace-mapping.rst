**New Features**

-  Cluster: Add resource pool to workspace mapping feature, allowing resource pools to be bound to
   specific workspaces. Bound resource pools can only be used by the workspaces they are bound to.
   Additionally adds the ability to configure a default compute resource pool and a default
   auxiliary resource pool for each workspace.
