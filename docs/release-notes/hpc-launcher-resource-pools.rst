**New Feature**

-  Cluster: Add support for launcher-provided resource pools.

   -  The enterprise edition of [HPE Machine Learning Development Environment]
      (https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning-development-environment.html)
      now allows for custom resource pools to be defined that submit work to an underlying Slurm/PBS
      partition on an HPC cluster with different submission options.
