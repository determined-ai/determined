**Improvements**

- Centralize sidebar options `Cluster`, `Job Queues` and `Cluster Logs` into `Cluster` page for a simplified layout.
- In order to provide a more precise view of resource pools, new fields like `accelerator` and `warm slots` have been added.
- Clicking on resource pool cards will lead to a detail page, which also includes a `Stats` tab showing average queued time by day.
