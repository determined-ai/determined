**Improvements**

-  Support configurable slot type for agents. Previously, we only
   supported auto-detecting the slot type for agents. It detected the
   GPUs and if there were no GPUs the agents would fall back to mapping
   one slot to all the CPUs. Now, this behavior can be configured to one
   of ``auto``, ``gpu``, ``cpu``, and ``none`` in the field
   ``slot_type`` of the agent configuration ``agent.yaml``. Dynamic
   agents having GPUs will be configured to ``gpu`` while those agents
   having no GPUs will be configured to ``none``. For static agents this
   field defaults to ``auto``. See the :ref:`Agent configuration
   <agent-configuration>` for details.
