**Improvements**

-  Support configurable slot type for agents. Previously, we only
   supported auto-detecting the slot type for agents. It detected the
   GPUs and if there were no GPUs the agents would fall back to mapping
   one slot to all the CPUs. Now, this behavior can be configured to one
   of ``gpu``, ``cpu``, and ``auto`` in the field ``slot_type`` of the
   agent configuration ``agent.yaml`` and defaults to ``auto``. Also,
   dynamic agents will be configured to ``gpu``. See the :ref:`Agent
   configuration <agent-configuration>` for details.
