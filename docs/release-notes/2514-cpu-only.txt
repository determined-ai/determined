**Improvements**

-  Added support for CPU-based training. This makes it possible to run
   Determined on server clusters without GPUs, including on-prem, AWS,
   GCP, and Kubernetes-based (default scheduler only) configurations.

-  **Breaking Change** REST API: rename ``*gpu*`` and ``*cpu*`` fields
   in ``ResourcePool`` object to ``*compute**`` and ``*aux*``.
