**New Features**

-  CLI: Add support for a ``--custom-tags`` flag to AWS ``det deploy aws up``

   -  A new argument is added to ``det deploy aws up`` that allows users to specify tags that should
      be added to the underlying CloudFormation stack.
   -  New custom tags will not replace automatically added tags such as ``deployment-type`` or
      ``managed-by``
   -  Any custom tags that should persist across updates should be always be included when using
      ``det deploy aws up`` -- if the argument is missing, all custom tags would be removed
