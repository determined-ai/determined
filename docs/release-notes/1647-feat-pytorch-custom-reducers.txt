**IMPROVEMENTS**

-  PyTorchTrial: Add experimental support for custom metric reducers
   with PyTorchTrial. Calculating advanced metrics like F1 score or mean
   IOU and returning multiple metrics from a single reducer are
   supported. See
   :meth:`determined.pytorch.PyTorchExperimentalContext.wrap_reducer()`
   for detailed documentation and code snippets.

   See ``determined/examples/features/custom_reducers_mnist_pytorch``
   for a fully running example of custom reducers. The example emits a
   per-class F1 score using the new custom reducers API.
