# Release Notes

This process is intended to ensure accurate and comprehensive release notes,
so Determined users can understand what has changed and the impact it has on
their use of the product.

The work required to write high-quality release notes is intended to be
spread over time and across project contributors instead of writing all of
the release notes at the last minute as part of cutting a new release.

## How To Write an Individual Release Note

Create a release note when you make a change that should be communicated to users,
classifying the release note according to one of the following categories:

* Bug Fixes
* Breaking Changes
* Improvements
* New Features

### Procedure

1. Create a release note as part of landing the change, itself, in the
   same PR or as part of a chain of PRs of a large feature.

   The author of the PR has the most context about the change being made and should be
   aware of any caveats or additional context that users should be informed about.

2. Write the release note entry as a separate file and add it to the
   `determined/docs/release-notes` directory. See the [example](#release-note-example), below.

   Writing guidelines can be relaxed for a release note to be more conversational than might
   be acceptable in the core documentation. Spelling, grammar, coherence, and completeness
   requirements still apply. Passing [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) checks is usually
   sufficient.

   * Name the file with the PR number as a prefix. For example, `1097-nvidia-a100-support.txt`.
   * The file should be in [reStructuredText](https://determinedai.atlassian.net/l/c/53h3PrPo) format
     and must start with the `:orphan:` metadata string to avoid errors when building the docs.
   * Specify one or more of the following categories, depending on the extent of the change:

     * `**Bug Fixes**`
     * `**Breaking Changes**`
     * `**Improvements**`
     * `**New Features**`

   * Enter a title for the change, or titles for each change, as one or more list elements.

     Begin each title with a prefix for the affected component:

     * `WebUI`
     * `Notebook`
     * `TensorBoard`
     * `Command`
     * `Shell`
     * `Experiment`
     * `API`
     * `Images`
     * or other applicable component.

   * Provide a short, descriptive, summary title.
   * In one or more list elements, provide more detailed description(s) of the change.

     Describe what changed, why the change was needed, and how the
     change affects the user. Do not give details of how the change was implemented.
     If there is a Jira issue associated with the change, the Jira description can be
     helpful as a guide to what context should also be provided in the release note.

     Be sure to highlight API changes and backward incompatibility, and describe any steps
     that must be taken to upgrade safely.

     Do not include:

     * links to Determined documentation
     * customer identifiers
     * internal project status or plans
     * Jira issue or PR identifiers

3. As part of the PR review, a documentation team member is assigned as a reviewer and
   reviews and approves the release note part of the PR.

### Release Note Example

```
:orphan:

**New Features**

-  GCP: Add support for provisioning Nvidia A100 GPU instances.

   -  Running workloads on A100 chips currently requires building a custom task
      environment with CUDA 11, because the default task environments provided by
      Determined contain either CUDA 10.0 or CUDA 10.1. The default task
      environments will be upgraded to CUDA 11 in a future release of Determined.
```

## How to Collect and Publish the Release Notes for a Release

1. As part of the release process, the release manager merges the individual release note files
together into the `docs/release-notes.txt` file, creating a new version heading.
2. Delete the individual files from `docs/release-notes/`.
3. Additional copy editing and formatting as needed.
