**New Features**

-  Add support for dynamic job modification using the job queue. Users can use the WebUI or CLI to
   change the priority/weight, resource pool, and queue position of jobs without having to cancel
   and resubmit them. This feature is currently available for the fair-share and priority
   schedulers. To update jobs through the WebUI, go to the **Job Queue** section and find the
   **Manage Job** option for a job. To update jobs using the CLI, use the ``det job update``
   command. Run ``det job update --help`` for more information.
