**Deprecated Features**

-  Legacy Tensorflow 1 + PyTorch 1.7 + CUDA 10.2 support is deprecated and will be removed in a
   future version. Final Tensorflow 1.15.5 patch was released in January 2021, and no further
   security patches are planned. Consequently, we recommend users to migrate to the modern
   Tensorflow 2 and PyTorch versions. Our default environment images currently ship with
   ``tensorflow==2.11.1`` and ``torch==1.12.0``.
