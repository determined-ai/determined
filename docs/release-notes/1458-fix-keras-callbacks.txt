**Fixes**

-  Fix support for Keras Callbacks.

   -  Previously, stateful Keras Callbacks (``EarlyStopping`` and
      ``ReduceLROnPlateau``) did not work in Determined across
      pause/activate boundaries. We have introduced Determined-friendly
      implementations, :class:`determined.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping`
      and :class:`determined.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau`, which
      address this shortcoming. User-defined callbacks may subclass
      :class:`determined.keras.callbacks.Callback` (and define
      ``get_state`` and ``load_state`` methods) to also benfit from this
      and other new features.

   -  Previously, Keras Callbacks which relied on ``on_epoch_end`` in
      Determined would see their ``on_epoch_end`` called every
      ``scheduling_unit`` batches by default. Now, ``on_epoch_end`` will
      be reliably called at the end of each epoch, as defined by the
      ``records_per_epoch`` setting in the experiment config. As before,
      ``on_epoch_end`` will not contain validation metrics, as the
      validation data is not always fresh at epoch boundaries.
      Therefore, the Determined implementations of
      :class:`~determined.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping` and
      :class:`~determined.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau` are both
      based on ``on_test_end``, which can be tuned using
      ``min_validation_period``.

**Deprecated Features**

-  Deprecate the name ``det.keras.TFKerasTensorBoard`` in favor of
   ``det.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard``. The old name will be removed
   eventually, and user code should be updated accordingly.
