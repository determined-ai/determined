**Bug Fixes**

-  Ensure database migrations run in transactions. The lack of transactional migrations surfaced as
   a bug where, if the master was restarted during a migration, it would attempt to rerun the
   migration when it was already partially or wholy applied, resulting in various SQL errors on
   non-idempotent DDL statements.
