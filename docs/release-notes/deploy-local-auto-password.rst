Security Fixes

   -  CLI: When deploying locally using ``det deploy local`` with ``master-up`` or ``cluster-up``
      commands and no user accounts have been created yet, an initial password will be automatically
      generated and shown to the user (with the option to change it) if neither
      ``security.initial_user_password`` in ``master.yaml`` nor the ``--initial-user-password`` CLI
      flag is present.
