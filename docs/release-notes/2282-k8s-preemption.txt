**New Features**

-  Add support for priority scheduling with preemption in Kubernetes.
   Setting the ``defaultScheduler`` field in ``values.yaml`` to
   ``preemption`` activates the scheduler, which is able to preempt
   experiments when higher priority ones are submitted. See
   :ref:`Priority Scheduling with Preemption on Kubernetes
   <priority-scheduling-on-kubernetes>` for more information.
