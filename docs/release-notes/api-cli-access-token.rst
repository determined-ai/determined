**New Features**

-  API/CLI: Add the ability to create and administer access tokens for users in automated
      workflows. Users can define the lifespan of these tokens, making it easier to securely
      authenticate and run processes. This feature enhances automation while maintaining strong
      security protocols by allowing tighter control over token usage and expiration.
