**New Features**

-  Core API is the first API offered by Determined that allows users to fully integrate arbitrary
   models and training loops into the Determined platform. All of the features offered by the
   higher-level Trial APIs, such as reporting metrics, pausing and reactivating, hyperparameter
   search, and distributed training, are now available to arbitrary models, frameworks, and training
   loops, with only light code changes. See the :ref:`user guide <core-getting-started>` and
   :ref:`reference documentation <core-reference>` to get started.

-  **Breaking Change** The Python SDK's ``Checkpoint.download()`` method now writes a differently
   formatted ``metadata.json`` file into the checkpoint directory. Previously, the JSON content in
   the file contained many system-defined fields, plus a ``metadata`` field that contained the
   user-defined metadata for the checkpoint, which was also available as a python object as
   ``Checkpoint.metadata``. Now, ``metadata.json`` contains only the user-defined metadata, and
   those metadata appear as top-level keys. Some of fields which were previously system-defined are
   now considered user-defined, even though they are uploaded automatically in Trial-based training.
   This decision is in-line with the Trial APIs now being optional, that is part of userspace, after
   the release of the Core API
