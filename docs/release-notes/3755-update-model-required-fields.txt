**Breaking Changes**

Changed the message body of PatchModelRequest and PatchModelVersionRequest such that the POST-ed
body is the PatchModel or PatchModelVersion object, instead of being wrapped in ``{ "model":
PatchModel }``.

Updated typing hints on other Model Registry API endpoints to make it clear which fields will be
returned in API responses.
