**Removed Features**

-  The old experimental namespace methods for custom reducers in both PyTorchTrial and
   EstimatorTrial have been removed. The experimental names were deprecated in 0.15.2 (April 2021)
   when custom reducers were promoted to general availability. Any users who have not already
   migrated to the non-experimental namespace for custom reducer methods must do so.
