**Improvement**

-  Slurm: Add support for disabling and enabling of agents.

   -  Administrators can now disable agents in Slurm. This is useful for maintenance or other
      reasons. Agents can be disabled or enabled via the `det agent disable` and `det agent enable`
      commands, or via the REST API.
