**Breaking Changes**

-  Web UI: Enforce password requirements for all new non-remote users: see
   :ref:`password-requirements`

      -  This applies to users created using the `Add User` button in the Web UI for admins.

      -  Admins may also change the passwords of other users with this same interface.

      -  This does not affect logging in with an existing user who already has an empty or
         non-compliant password, but we recommend setting good passwords for such users as soon as
         possible.
