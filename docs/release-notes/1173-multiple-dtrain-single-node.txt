**Feature Upgrades**

- Update scheduler to allow multiple distributed training jobs per node when using docker bridge networking.

  - The scheduler will now schedule distributed training jobs onto shared agents if host networking
    is not being used. For example, in a cluster of 8-slot agents, 2 4-slot distributed training
    jobs may now be scheduled per node.
