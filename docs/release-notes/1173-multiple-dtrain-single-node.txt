**New Features**

- Support running multiple distributed training jobs on a single agent.

  - In previous versions of Determined, a distributed training job could only be
    scheduled on an agent if it was configured to use all of the GPUs on that
    agent. In this release, that restriction has been lifted: for example, an
    agent with 8 GPUs can now be used to run two 4-GPU distributed training
    jobs. This feature is particularly useful as a way to improve utilization
    and fair resource allocation for smaller clusters.
