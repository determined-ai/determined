**Improvements**

-  CLI: Default to provisioning Nvidia T4 GPU instances.

   -  Command line deployments will now default to provisioning Nvidia T4 GPU instances instead of
      K80 instances. This change is intended to improve the performance/cost and driver support of
      the default deployment.
