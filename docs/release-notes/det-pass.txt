**Improvements**

-  CLI: The ``det`` CLI command now supports setting the environment variables ``DET_USER`` and
   ``DET_PASS`` to skip the need for running ``det user login`` allowing for easier use of the
   Determined CLI in scripts. ``det user login`` is still the preferred mechanism for most use cases
   of the CLI.
