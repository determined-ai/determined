**Improvements**

-  CLI: Commands now support setting the environment variables ``DET_USER`` and ``DET_PASS`` to skip
   the need for running ``det user login`` allowing for easier use of the Determined CLI in scripts.
   ``det user login`` is still the preferred mechanism for most use cases of the CLI.
