** New Features **

- Custom Searcher provides an API for users to implement their own logic to coordinate across
  multiple training jobs. This enables easy implementation of custom meta algorithms like
  hyperparameter tuning and ensembling methods. See
  :ref:`Custom Search Methods<topic-guides_hp-tuning-det_custom>` for more information.
