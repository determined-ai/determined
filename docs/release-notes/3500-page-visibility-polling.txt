**New Features**

-  Web: Polling can potentially be an expensive operation. To reduce unnecessary polling, we use
   modern browser Page Visiblity API to detect changes in page visibility, which maps to whether the
   user is activately focused on the page/tab or not. If the page is hidden, ongoing polling are
   stopped. When the page becomes visible again, the previously active polling are restarted.
