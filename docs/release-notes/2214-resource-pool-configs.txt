**New Features**

-  Add support for the ``--devices``, ``--cap-add``, and ``--cap-drop``
   arguments to the ``docker run`` command. These are configured in an
   experiment or command/notebook config via ``resources.devices``,
   ``environment.add_capabilities``, and
   ``environment.drop_capabilities``. These settings can combine to
   allow an experiment to take advantage of cluster hardware not
   previously available to training or notebook task. See
   :ref:`experiment-configuration` for more details. These
   configurations are only honored by resource managers of type
   ``agent``, and are ignored by resource managers of type
   ``kubernetes``.

-  Add support for configuring distinct ``task_container_defaults`` for
   each resource pool configured on the cluster. This can allow
   different resource pools which may have very different hardware to
   configure tasks in each pool with the correct settings. When a
   resource pool has a ``task_container_defaults`` field set, the
   top-level ``task_container_defaults`` will be ignored for tasks
   launched in that pool (there is no merging behavior. See Resource
   Pool configuration under :ref:`cluster-configuration` for more
   information.
