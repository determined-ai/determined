**Fix warm starting with large checkpoint data**

  - Our previous solution to warm starting from a checkpoint was to pass the checkpoint
    data directly to an environment variable. However, there's a limit to how much data you
    can pass directly to an environment variable. This change modifies the master and
    harness to load checkpoint data as a file to resolve these issues.
