**Improvements**

   -  Added ``self.context.configure_fit()`` to the Determined
      TFKerasTrial API. Please see :ref:`tf-keras-trial` for detail.

**Deprecations**

   -  Deprecated the old ``det.keras.SequenceAdapter``.
      ``SequenceAdapter`` will be removed in a future version. Users
      should use ``self.context.configure_fit()`` instead, which is both
      more capable and more similar to the normal ``tf.keras`` APIs.
