**Improvements**

-  Security: Setting ``registry_auth.serveraddress`` will now only send credentials to the server
   configured. Not setting ``registry_auth.serveraddress`` is now deprecated when ``registry_auth``
   is set. Soon ``serveraddress`` will be required whenever ``registry_auth`` is set.

-  Agent: Users may now run ``docker login`` on agent host machines to authenticate with Docker
   registries. Note if an agent is running inside a Docker container then ``~/.docker/config.json``
   will need to be mounted inside the container to ``$HOME/.docker/config.json`` (by default
   ``/root/.docker/config.json``).
