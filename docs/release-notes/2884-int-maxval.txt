**Fixes**

-  Include ``maxval`` in ``int``-type hyperparameter ranges. Previously, the docs said that the
   endpoints of the hyperparameter were both inclusive, but in reality the upper limit ``maxval``
   was never actually selected for any trials.

-  **Breaking Change** The reproducibility of hyperparameter selection may differ between Determined
   v0.16.5 and v0.17.0 for hyperparameter searches containing ``int``-type hyperparameters, due to
   the above-mentioned fix. However, the reproducibility of model training for any given set of
   pre-chosen hyperparameters should be unaffected.
