**Improvements**

-  Default storage location for checkpoint data in local clusters
   deployed via `det deploy local` has been changed to OS-specific user
   data dir (e.g. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/determined` or
   `~/.local/share/determined` on Linux, and `~/Library/Application
   Support/determined` on macOS). Previously, `/tmp` was used. This
   location can be changed using `--storage-host-path` command line flag
   of `det deploy local`. If users provide their own custom
   `master.yaml` via `--master-config-path`, `checkpoint_storage`
   configuration in yaml will continue to take precedence.
