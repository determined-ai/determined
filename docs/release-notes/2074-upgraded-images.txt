**Improvements**

-  The default environment images have been updated to CUDA 10.2,
   PyTorch 1.8, and TensorFlow 1.15.5 with Python 3.7. Previous images
   are still available but must be specified in the experiment or
   command configuration. It is recommended to validate the performance
   of models when changing CUDA versions as some models can experience
   significant changes in training time, etc. Consult the "Environment
   Configuration" section in the documentation for details.
