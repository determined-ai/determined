**Improvements**

-  Docs: reorganize documents to be user-friendlier.

      -  Merge some documents from how-to guides, topic guides, and reference guides. Users would
         need just read very few documents rather than jump around between documents to understand
         what they need to do in Determined.

      -  Merge most of best practices with how-to guides. Users would know the best practices the
         first time they learn something.

      -  Decompose the first-level FAQ document and moves different questions to different topics so
         that users would have an expectation of what common issues they might hit.
