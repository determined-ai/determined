**Improvements**

-  Model Hub: add support for panoptic segmentation.

   -  Model Hub mmdetection now supports panoptic segmentation task in addition to object detection.
      Previously, the associated docker image lacked dependencies for panoptic segmentation. Users
      can now use mmdetection configs under ``panoptic_fpn`` and also the ``coco_panoptic`` dataset
      base config.
