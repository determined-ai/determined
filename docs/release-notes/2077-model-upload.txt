**Fixes**

-  Model code uploaded to checkpoints will now match the model code
   provided during experiment creation. Previously, it may have included
   additional files that had been bind-mounted in with a
   ``container_path`` that was either relative or was a subdirectory of
   ``/run/determined/workdir``.
