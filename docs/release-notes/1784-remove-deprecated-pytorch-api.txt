**Removed Features**

-  Trial API: The old Pytorch APIs are removed, including:

   -  the method ``build_model``, ``optimizer``, and
      ``create_lr_scheduler`` in
      :class:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial`;

   -  the callback ``on_before_optimizer_step``,
      ``optimizations.mixed_precision`` in the experiment configuration;

   -  the ``model`` arguments to
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial.train_batch`,
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial.evaluate_batch`, and
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial.evaluate_full_dataset`.

   The experiments that are forked from those which use the old Pytorch
   APIs cannot run. However, the checkpoints from the old experiments
   will still be supported.
