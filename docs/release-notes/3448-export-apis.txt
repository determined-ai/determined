**New Features**

-  There are new methods for loading checkpoints, which are framework specific:
      -  :meth:`det.pytorch.load_trial_from_checkpoint_dir()`
      -  :meth:`det.keras.load_model_from_checkpoint_dir()`
      -  :meth:`det.estimator.load_estimator_from_checkpoint_dir()`

   These new methods are part of a larger effort to support more frameworks.

**Deprecations**

-  ``Checkpoint.load()`` is deprecated. You should instead combine ``Checkpoint.download()`` with
   one of the new framework-specific functions.

-  The following methods on objects in ``determined.experimental.client`` are formally deprecated
   (even though they were not technically public methods previously): - ``Model.from_json`` -
   ``Checkpoint.from_json`` - ``Checkpoint.parse_metadata`` - ``Checkpoint.get_type``

   These methods will be removed in a future version.
