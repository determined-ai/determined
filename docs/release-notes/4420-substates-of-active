**API Changes**

- The ``STATE_ACTIVE`` state for Experiments and Trials is divided into four sub-states:
 ``STATE_QUEUED``, ``STATE_PULLING``, ``STATE_STARTING``, and ``STATE_RUNNING``.
 Queries to ``GetExperimentsRequest`` which filter by state continue to use
 ``STATE_ACTIVE``.

- The state of Tasks is adjusted to match Experiments and Trials. Previous
  ``STATE_PENDING`` and ``STATE_ASSIGNED`` become ``STATE_QUEUED``.
