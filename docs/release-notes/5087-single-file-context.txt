**Improvements**

-  Support single-file contexts in the CLI.  Users who want to upload a single file into a notebook
   or shell may  now specify a single file as the ``--context`` argument, like ``det notebook start
   --context MY_FILE``.  Previously accomplishing the same required creating an empty directory,
   copying the file into that directory, and specifying the directory as the ``--context``.
