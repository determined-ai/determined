**Improvements**

-  Support a new ``-i``/``--include`` option in task-starting CLI commands.  The context option
   (``--context``) is useful for copying a directory of files into the task container, but it may
   only be provided once, and it can be clunky if you only care about one or two files.  The
   Include option also copies files into the task container, but:

      -  The directory name is preserved, so ``-i my_data/`` would result in a directory named
         ``my_data/`` appearing in the working directory of the task container.

      -  It may point to a file, so ``-i my_data.csv`` will work.

      -  It may be specified multiple times to include multiple files and/or directories.
