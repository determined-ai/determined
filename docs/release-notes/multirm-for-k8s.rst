New Features:

Kubernetes: Add ability to set up Determined master service on one Kubernetes cluster and schedule
workloads across the same or other Kubernetes clusters. Additional non-default resource managers and
resource pools are configured under the master configuration options additional_resource_managers
and resource_pools (additional resource managers are required to have at least one resource pool
defined). Additional resource managers and their resource pools must have unique names.

WebUI: Add ability to view resource manager name for resource pools.
