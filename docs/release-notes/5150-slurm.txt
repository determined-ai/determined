**Breaking Changes**

-  Additional Slurm options formerly specified in the experiment environment section 
   are now part of a new Slurm section of the experiment configuration. For example,
   what was formerly written as:

   .. code:: yaml
    environment:
    ...
      slurm:
        - --mem-per-cpu=10
        - --exclusive

   Is now specified as:

   .. code:: yaml
    environment:
    ...
    slurm:
      sbatch_args:
        - --mem-per-cpu=10
        - --exclusive
