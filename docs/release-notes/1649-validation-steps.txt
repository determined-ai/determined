**Improvements**

-  Support ``validation_steps`` in ``TFKerasTrial``'s
   ``context.configure_fit()``. ``validation_steps`` means the same
   thing in Determined as it does in ``model.fit()``, and has the same
   limitation that it only applies when ``validation_data`` is of type
   ``tf.data.Dataset``.
