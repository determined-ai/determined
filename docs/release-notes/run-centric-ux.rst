**New Features**

-  WebUI: In the Experimental features, Flat Runs View is now "on" by default in the :ref:`WebUI
   <web-ui-if>`\. Users can still toggle this feature "off".
-  This update improves the ability to compare model performance between different trials, based on
   user feedback that most Determined users run single-trial experiments.
-  "Experiments" is now renamed to "searches" and "trials" is now renamed to "runs" for better
   clarity.
-  The "experiment list" is renamed the "run list", showing all trials from experiments in the
   project. It functions similarly to the previous new experiment list.
-  Multi-trial experiments can be viewed in the new searches view, which allows for sorting,
   filtering and navigating multi-trial experiments.
-  When viewing a multi-trial experiment, a list of trials is displayed, allowing for sorting,
   filtering and arbitrary comparison between trials.
