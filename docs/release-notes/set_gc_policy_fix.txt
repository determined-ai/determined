** Bug Fixes ** 

- Command: The set-gc-policy CLI command was failing because of a bug in the API that it calls. The bug was introduced in a previous PR where the format of the checkpoints returned ExperimentCheckpointsToGCRaw in master/internal/db/postgres_checkpoints changed. This method's output was directly returned from the API. I have added logic in the API to return an appropriate format.
