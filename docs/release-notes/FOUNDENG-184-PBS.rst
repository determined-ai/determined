**New Features**

-  Cluster: The enterprise edition of `HPE Machine Learning Development Environment
   <https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning-development-environment.html>`_
   can now be deployed on a PBS cluster. When using PBS scheduler, HPE Machine Learning Development
   Environment delegates all job scheduling and prioritization to the PBS workload manager. This
   integration enables existing PBS workloads and HPE Machine Learning Development Environment
   workloads to coexist and access all of the advanced capabilities of the PBS workload manager. You
   can use either Singularity or Podman for the container runtime.
