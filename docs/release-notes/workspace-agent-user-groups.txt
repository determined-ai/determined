**Improvements**

-  Added an ability to set the Unix user and group on the agent that the task runs as on workspace
   level. When set, it will take precedence over user's own agent user and group setting.

**Breaking Changes**

-  CLI: Workspace rename operation now accepts the new workspace name as an optional ``--name``
   flag, for example: ``det workspace edit OLD_WORKSPACE_NAME --name NEW_WORKSPACE``.
