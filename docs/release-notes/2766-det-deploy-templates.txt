**New Features**

-  Add the ability to use customizable master configuration templates in ``det deploy aws|gcp``.

-  **Breaking Change:** This version of ``det deploy`` will not be able to deploy previous versions
   of Determined. If you need to deploy an older version, please use a matching version of
   `determined` package.

-  **Breaking Change:** ``det master config`` will now output yaml by default instead of json. To
   preserve the old behaviour, use ``det master config -o json`` instead.
