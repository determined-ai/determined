**Improvements**

-  Documentation: Add a guide for :ref:`model-debug`. The new guide will
   walk you step-by-step through solving problems with a model in
   Determined, with a focus on testing features incrementally until the
   model is fully working. It may also be useful when porting new models
   to Determined.
