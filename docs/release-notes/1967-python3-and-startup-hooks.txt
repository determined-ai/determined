**New Features**

-  Support ``startup-hook.sh`` for notebooks and shells. This is the
   same mechanism supported by experiments. See
   :ref:`notebook-configuration` for more details.

**Improvements**

-  Invoke ``python`` as ``python3`` rather than as ``python3.6``. This
   makes it possible to use custom images containing higher versions of
   Python with Determined (3.6 is still the minimum required version).

   If the desired ``python`` cannot be found as ``python3``, it is now
   possible to customize this invocation by setting the environment
   variable ``DET_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/python3``, for experiments,
   notebooks, and shells.
