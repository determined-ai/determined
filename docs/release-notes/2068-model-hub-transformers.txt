**New Features**

-  Model Hub: We released Determined's Model Hub Library to make it easy
   to train models from third-party libraries with a Determined cluster.
   The first library supported in Model Hub is the `Huggingface
   transformers library for NLP <https://huggingface.co/transformers>`_.
