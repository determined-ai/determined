**Improvements**

-  Logs: In the WebUI, add a tab for specifically for displaying log search results. Clicking on any
   search result will take users directly to the relevant position in the log, allowing them to
   easily view logs both before and after the matched entry. Additionally, add support for
   regex-based searches, providing more flexible log filtering. For more details, refer to
   :ref:`log_policies <config-log-policies>`.
