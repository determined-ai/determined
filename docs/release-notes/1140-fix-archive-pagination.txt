**Bug Fixes**

- Correct table pagination behavior.

  - Hide pagination when there are less than 10 items.
  - Show pagination and page size picker when there are 10 or more items.
  - Persist pagination and page size picker (both are strongly tied to each other
    via Ant Design). This will ensure that the page size picker can stick around
    to allow the user to change the page size even when the number of entries is
    less than page size.
