**API Change**

Changing the user password through the CLI, WebUI, or API request now happens through a PATCH
request to ``/api/v1/users/:username``. If you change passwords through the up-to-date CLI then the
change should be seamless. The ``password`` field expects the password to be salted and hashed on
the client-side.
