**API Change**

Changing the user password through the CLI, WebUI, or API request now happens through a PATCH
request to `/api/v1/users/:username`. If you change passwords through the up-to-date CLI then the
change should be seamless. The `password` parameter expects the password to be hashed and salted on
the client-side.
