**Improvements**

- Update primary WebUI navigation.

  - Converge both the top navbar and the sidebar into a primary side navigation.
  - Add support for collapsing the side navigation into a thin bar to maximize
    real estate for content.
  - Add animation to support smooth transition between the collapsed mode and
    the expanded mode.
  - Save the collapsed/expanded state of the navigation to be able to restore
    the same state when revisting the app on the same browser.
