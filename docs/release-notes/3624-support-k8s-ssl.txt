**New Features**

-  Now supports setting root certificates for the DB via the determined helm chart. This allows
   determined to use SSL to connect to the DB without having to replace the master config manually.
   To use this feature, save the certificate in a configmap or secret and fill out the following
   fields from ``values.yaml``: ``sslMode``, ``sslRootCert``, ``resourceType``, and
   ``certResourceName``
