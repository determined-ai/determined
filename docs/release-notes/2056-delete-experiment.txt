**New Features**

-  API: Add a new endpoint to delete experiments. This endpoint is only
   enabled for admin users and deletes all resources associated with an
   experiment. This includes checkpoint storage, Tensorboards, trial
   logs from all backends and metadata, like history and metrics, stored
   in PostgreSQL.
