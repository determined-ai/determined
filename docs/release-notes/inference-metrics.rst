**New Features**

-  SDK: Support for tracking and viewing batch inference metrics

   -  Adds ability to keep track of what experiments use particular checkpoint or model version for
      inference.
   -  New ``.get_metrics()`` functionality added to ``checkpoint.Checkpoint`` and
      ``model.ModelVersion`` SDK objects to fetch related metrics.

**Improvements**

-  SDK: ``client.stream_training_metrics()`` and ``client.stream_validation_metrics()`` deprecated.
   Please use ``client.stream_trials_metrics()`` instead.
