**Improvements**

-  deployment: support the deployment tool command ```det-deploy aws
   list``. It lists all the cloudFormation stacks that are managed by
   det-deploy aws. It recognizes the Determined stacks by finding if
   there exists a tag pair ``managed-by:determined``. It does not list
   out the stacks that are spun up by previous versions of det-deploy.
