**New Features**

-  New Docker images are available for experiments and commands to support
   CUDA 11, as well as some updated versions of frameworks on CUDA 10.1.
   It is recommended to validate the performance of models when changing CUDA
   versions as some models can experience significant changes in training time,
   etc. Consult the "Environment Configuration" section in the documentation for
   details.
