**New Features**

-  New Docker images are available for experiments and commands to
   support CUDA 11, as well as some updated versions of frameworks on
   CUDA 10.1. It is recommended to validate the performance of models
   when changing CUDA versions as some models can experience significant
   changes in training time, etc. Consult the "Environment
   Configuration" section in the documentation for details.
