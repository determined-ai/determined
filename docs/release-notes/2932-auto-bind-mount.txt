**Removed Features**

-  **Breaking Change** Remove ``--auto-bind-mount`` support from ``det deploy local``. The new
   ``--auto-work-dir`` feature should be a strictly better experience. Users who depended on the
   ``shared_fs`` directory created by ``--auto-bind-mount`` can implement the same behavior by
   calling ``det deploy local cluster_up`` with a ``--master-config-path`` pointing to a
   ``master.yaml`` file containing the following text:

   .. code:: yaml

      task_container_defaults:
        bind_mounts:
          container_path: ./shared_fs
          host_path: /path/to/your/HOME/dir

**New Features**

-  Add a new ``--auto-work-dir`` feature to ``det deploy local``. Setting ``--auto-work-dir
   /some/path`` will have two effects: First, ``/some/path`` will be bind-mounted into the container
   (still as ``/some/path``). Second, interactive jobs (Notebooks, Shells, and Commands) will run in
   the provided working directory by default. Note that by default, containers run as root, so you
   may want to configure your user with ``det user`` such that interactive jobs run as your real
   user.
