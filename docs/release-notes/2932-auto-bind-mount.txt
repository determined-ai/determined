**Removed Features**

-  **Breaking Change** Remove ``--auto-bind-mount`` support from ``det deploy local``. The new
   ``work_dir`` feature should be a strictly better experience. Users who depended on the
   ``shared_fs`` directory created by ``--auto-bind-mount`` can implement the same behavior by
   calling ``det deploy local cluster_up`` with a ``--master-config-path`` pointing to a
   ``master.yaml`` file containing the following text:

   .. code:: yaml

      task_container_defaults:
        bind_mounts:
          container_path: ./shared_fs
          host_path: /path/to/your/HOME/dir
