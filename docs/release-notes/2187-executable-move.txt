**Improvements**

-  **Breaking Change:** CLI: `det` and `det-deploy` executables have
   been moved to `determined` package, which now includes all of
   Determined libraries and tools. `determined-cli`,
   `determined-deploy`, and `determined-common` packages are now
   deprecated.

   -  When upgrading from older versions, `det` command may break for
      some users because of `pip` limitations. Please uninstall outdated
      packages, and then reinstall determined. See more at
      :ref:`upgrading-from-before-0_15_0`.
