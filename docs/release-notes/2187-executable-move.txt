**Improvements**

-  **Breaking Change:** CLI: ``det`` and ``det-deploy`` executables have
   been moved to the ``determined`` package, which now includes all
   Determined libraries and tools. The ``determined-cli``,
   ``determined-deploy``, and ``determined-common`` packages are now
   deprecated.

   -  When upgrading from older versions, ``det`` command may break for
      some users because of ``pip`` limitations. Please uninstall
      outdated packages, and then reinstall Determined. See more at
      :ref:`upgrading-from-before-0_15_0`.
