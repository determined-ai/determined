**Fixes**

-  ``PyTorchTrial``'s
   :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext.to_device` no longer
   throws errors on non-numeric Numpy-like data. As PyTorch is still
   unable to move such data to the GPU, non-numeric arrays will simply
   remain on the CPU. This is especially useful to NLP practitioners who
   wish to make use of Numpy's string manipulations anywhere in their
   data pipelines.
