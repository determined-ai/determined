 Training: Implement Training APIs
###################################

The training APIs is the interface between Determined and the user's application framework (e.g.,
Keras, TensorFlow), in terms of loading training data, describing a model architecture, and
specifying the underlying iterative optimization training algorithms.

The interface is called the Trial API. With the :ref:`Trial API <model-definitions_trial-api>`,
developers expose the components of their model and training to Determined's training loop
implementation.

To read more about the Trial API, see:
