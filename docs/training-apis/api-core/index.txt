 Core API
##########

The Core API lets you train arbitrary models in a way that integrates seamlessly with the Determined
platform. While you can run arbitrary models without using the Core API and have full access to the
following features:

-  schedule single-GPU jobs on a Determined cluster, on-premise or on-cloud
-  track and view training job logs using the WebUI or CLI
-  track experiment configurations and model definitions
-  track random seeds
-  interactive experiment labeling

Architecturally, each of the higher-level APIs, including PyTorchTrial, Keras, Estimator, and
Lightning, is implemented using the Core API. With a small number of code changes and using the Core
API, you gain access to the following additional capabilities:

-  metrics tracking and visualization
-  checkpoint tracking
-  hyperparameter search
-  interactive job pause and resume using the WebUI
-  performant spot-instance support
-  running on a single or multiple GPUs

This section shows you how to get started using the Core API and how to implement the above
capabilities.
