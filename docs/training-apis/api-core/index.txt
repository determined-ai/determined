 Core API
##########

The Core API lets you train arbitrary models in Determined, but in a way that you can integrate
seamlessly with the entire Determined platform. Technically, no interaction with the Core API is
required to run arbitrary models on Determined, in which case you will still already have access to
the following platform features:

-  scheduling single-gpu jobs on a Determined cluster (on-premise or on-cloud)
-  tracking/viewing logs from training jobs in the webui or cli
-  tracking of experiment configurations and model definitions
-  tracking of random seeds
-  interactve labeling of experiments

With a small amount of code changes, you can also integrate with each of the following features of
the Determined platform:

-  metrics tracking & visualizations
-  checkpoint tracking
-  hyperparameter search
-  pausing & resuming jobs interactively from the webui
-  performant spot-instance support
-  running on one gpu, or across many gpus

The Core API is used behind-the-scenes to implement each of the higher-level APIs Determined offers
(PyTorchTrial, Keras, Estimator, Lightning, etc), so with the Core API, you really have the full
capabilities of the Determined platform at your fingertips!
