`The MMDetection library <https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_ is a popular library for
object detection. It provides implementations for many popular object detection approaches like
Faster-RCNN and Mask-RCNN in addition to cutting edge methods from the research community.

**model-hub** makes it easy to use MMDetection with Determined while keeping the developer
experience as close as possible to what it's like working directly with **MMDetection**. Our library
serves as an alternative to the trainer used by MMDetection (see `mmcv's runner
<https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/understand_mmcv/runner.html>`_) and provides access to all of
Determined's benefits including:

-  Easy multi-node distributed training with no code modifications. Determined automatically sets up
   the distributed backend for you.
-  Experiment monitoring and tracking, artifact tracking, and :ref:`state-of-the-art hyperparameter
   search <hyperparameter-tuning>` without requiring third-party integrations.
-  :ref:`Automated cluster management, fault tolerance, and job rescheduling <features>` so you
   don't have to worry about provisioning resources or babysitting your experiments.

Given the benefits above, we think this library will be particularly useful to you if any of the
following apply:

-  You want to perform object detection using a powerful integrated platform that will scale easily
   with your needs.
-  You are an Determined user that wants to get started quickly with **MMDetection**.
-  You are a **MMDetection** user that wants to easily run more advanced workflows like multi-node
   distributed training and advanced hyperparameter search.
-  You are a **MMDetection** user looking for a single platform to manage experiments, handle
   checkpoints with automated fault tolerance, and perform hyperparameter search/visualization.

The easiest way to use MMDetection is to start with the provided `experiment configuration for
Faster-RCNN
<https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/tree/master/model_hub/examples/mmdetection/fasterrcnn.yaml>`_.
The associated README_ is a tutorial on how to use MMDetection with Determined and covers how to
modify the configuration for custom behavior.
