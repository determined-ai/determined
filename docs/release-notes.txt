Version 0.13.8
==============

**Release Date:** November 17, 2020

**New Features**

-  API: Add support for models that subclass ``tf.keras.Model`` when
   using the Determined TFKerasTrial API. This is a new feature that
   became available starting in Tensorflow 2.2, allowing user to further
   customize their training process.

-  Deployment: When using the ``simple`` deployment type with
   ``det-deploy aws``, you can now use the ``--agent-subnet-id`` flag to
   specify which existing subnet to launch agents in. As each subnet is
   associated with a single availability zone, this allows users to
   explicitly choose an availability zone that has GPU instances (there
   is no public information about which availability zones have GPU
   instances so trial and error is the suggested approach).

-  Logs: Support filtering trial logs by individual fields in the CLI.
   Log entries for trials can now be filtered by container ID, agent ID,
   log level, and other fields. See ``det trial logs --help`` for more
   information.

-  Security: Allow the master to use a TLS certificate that is valid for
   a different name than the agents use to connect to it. This ability
   is useful in situations where the master is accessed using multiple
   different addresses (e.g., private and public IP addresses of a cloud
   instance). The agent now accepts a
   ``--security-tls-master-cert-name`` option to override the expected
   name in the master's TLS certificate. The CLI uses the
   ``DET_MASTER_CERT_NAME`` environment variable for the same purpose."

**Improvements**

-  **Breaking Change:** API: Perform salting and hashing on server-side
   for the password change endpoint. This makes this endpoint consistent
   with the new login endpoint described at
   https://docs.determined.ai/latest/rest-api/ .

-  **Breaking Change:** Logging: Start using Fluent Bit for handling
   trial logs internally. The agent machines now need to have access to
   the ``fluent/fluent-bit:1.6`` Docker image. If the Determined agent
   machines are able to connect to Docker Hub, they will pull it
   automatically and no changes are required; if not, the image must be
   manually made available beforehand. The Determined agent accepts a
   ``--fluent-logging-image`` option to specify an alternate name for
   the image. This change is part of an effort to improve the handling
   of trial logs by increasing scalability and allowing more options for
   log storage.

-  Agent: Support configurable slot types for agents. Previously,
   Determined only supported auto-detecting the slot type for agents. If
   Determined did not detect any GPUs, the agents would fall back to
   mapping one slot to all the CPUs. With this change, this behavior can
   be configured to one of ``auto``, ``gpu``, and ``none`` in the field
   ``slot_type`` of the agent configuration ``agent.yaml``. Dynamic
   agents having GPUs will be configured to ``gpu`` while those agents
   having no GPUs will be configured to ``none``. For static agents this
   field defaults to ``auto``. See :ref:`Agent configuration
   <agent-configuration>` for details.

-  API: Add ``self.context.wrap_optimizer()`` to the Determined
   TFKerasTrial API. Please see :ref:`tf-keras-trial` for detail.

-  API: Add tf.keras DCGAN example that subclasses ``tf.keras.Model``.

-  API: Add ``self.context.configure_fit()`` to the Determined
   TFKerasTrial API. Many parameters which would be passed to
   ``model.fit()``, such as ``class_weight``, ``verbose``, or
   ``workers``, can now be passed to ``configure_fit()`` and will be
   honored by ``TFKerasTrial``. Please see :ref:`tf-keras-trial` for
   detail.

-  Kubernetes: Add option to configure the service type of the
   Determined deployed database in the Determined Helm Chart. This is
   useful if your cluster does not support ClusterIP, which is the
   service type that is used by default.

-  WebUI: Make the page/tab title more descriptive.

-  WebUI: Add navigation sidebar, breadcrumb, and back buttons to log
   view pages.

-  WebUI: Update the trial and master log buttons to open in the same
   page by default, with the option to open in a new tab.

-  WebUI: Update trial details URL to include the experiment id.

**Bug Fixes**

-  API: Fix support for Keras Callbacks.

   -  Previously, stateful Keras Callbacks (``EarlyStopping`` and
      ``ReduceLROnPlateau``) did not work in Determined across
      pause/activate boundaries. We have introduced Determined-friendly
      implementations, :class:`determined.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping`
      and :class:`determined.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau`, which
      address this shortcoming. User-defined callbacks may subclass
      :class:`determined.keras.callbacks.Callback` (and define
      ``get_state`` and ``load_state`` methods) to also benefit from
      this and other new features.

   -  Previously, Keras Callbacks which relied on ``on_epoch_end`` in
      Determined would see their ``on_epoch_end`` called every
      ``scheduling_unit`` batches by default. Now, ``on_epoch_end`` will
      be reliably called at the end of each epoch, as defined by the
      ``records_per_epoch`` setting in the experiment config. As before,
      ``on_epoch_end`` will not contain validation metrics, as the
      validation data is not always fresh at epoch boundaries.
      Therefore, the Determined implementations of
      :class:`~determined.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping` and
      :class:`~determined.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau` are both
      based on ``on_test_end``, which can be tuned using
      ``min_validation_period``.

-  API: Fix issue that occasionally made TFKerasTrial hang for multi-GPU
   training during ``COMPUTE_VALIDATION_STEP``.

-  Kubernetes: Gracefully handle cases where the Kubernetes API server
   responds with unexpected object types.

-  Scheduler: Fix not being able to find resource pools for experiments.

-  Scheduler: Fix not being able to disable slots.

-  WebUI: Prevent navigation item tooltips from showing up when hovering
   outside of the navigation bar.

-  WebUI: Fix an issue where the experiment archive action button was
   out of sync.

-  WebUI: Fix experiment actions to not display a loading spinner.

**Deprecated Features**

-  API: Deprecate the name ``det.keras.TFKerasTensorBoard`` in favor of
   ``det.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard``. The old name will be removed
   eventually, and user code should be updated accordingly.

-  API: Deprecated the old ``det.keras.SequenceAdapter``.
   ``SequenceAdapter`` will be removed in a future version. Users should
   use ``self.context.configure_fit()`` instead, which is both more
   capable and more similar to the normal ``tf.keras`` APIs.

Version 0.13.7
==============

**Release Date:** October 29, 2020

**New Features**

-  Add support for running workloads on spot instances on AWS. Spot
   instances can be up to 70% cheaper than on-demand instances. If a
   spot instance is terminated, Determined's built-in fault tolerance
   means that model training will continue on a different agent
   automatically. Spot instances can be enabled by setting ``spot:
   true`` in the :ref:`cluster-configuration`. For more details, see the
   guide on using :ref:`aws-spot`.

-  Support `MMDetection <https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection>`__,
   a popular library for object detection, in Determined. MMDetection
   allows users to easily train state-of-the-art object detection
   models; with Determined, users can take things one step further with
   cutting-edge distributed training and hyperparameter tuning to
   further boost performance. See the `Determined implementation of
   MMDetection
   <https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/tree/master/examples/computer_vision/mmdetection_pytorch>`__
   for more information on how to get started.

-  WebUI: Allow the experiments list page to be filtered by labels.
   Selecting more than one label will filter experiments by the
   intersection of the selected labels.

**Deprecated Features**

-  Deprecate the :ref:`simple
   <topic-guides_hp-tuning-det_adaptive-simple>` and :ref:`advanced
   <topic-guides_hp-tuning-det_adaptive-advanced>` adaptive
   hyperparameter search algorithms. They will be removed in a future
   release. Both algorithms have been replaced with
   :ref:`topic-guides_hp-tuning-det_adaptive-asha`, which has
   state-of-the-art performance, as well as better scalability and
   resource-efficiency.

**Improvements**

-  Documentation: Add a guide for :ref:`setup-eks-cluster`.

-  Master: Support a minimum instance count for dynamic agents. The
   master will attempt to scale the cluster to at least the configured
   value at all times. This is configurable via
   ``provisioner.min_instances`` in the :ref:`cluster-configuration`.
   This will increase responsiveness to workload demand because agent(s)
   will be ready even when the cluster is idle.

-  Kubernetes: Improve the performance of the ``/agents`` endpoint for
   Kubernetes deployments. This will improve the performance of the
   cluster page in the WebUI, as well as when using ``det slot list``
   and ``det task list`` via the CLI.

-  Kubernetes: Release version ``0.3.0`` of the Determined Helm chart.

-  WebUI: Improve metric selection on the trial detail page. This should
   improve filtering for trials with many metrics.

-  WebUI: Use scientific notation when appropriate for floating point
   metric values.

-  WebUI: Show both experiment and trial TensorBoard sources when
   applicable.

**Bug Fixes**

-  WebUI: Fix an issue where TensorBoard sources did not display
   properly for TensorBoards started via the CLI.
-  WebUI: Fix an issue with rendering boolean hyperparameters in the
   WebUI.
-  CLI: Fix an issue where trial IDs were occasionally not displayed
   when running ``det task list`` or ``det slot list`` in the CLI.
-  Master: Fix the default value for the ``fit`` field if the
   ``scheduler`` is set in the :ref:`cluster-configuration`.

Version 0.13.6
==============

**Release Date:** October 14, 2020

**Improvements**

-  Agent: The ``boot_disk_source_image`` field for GCP dynamic agents
   and ``image_id`` field for AWS dynamic agents are now optional. If
   omitted, the default value is the Determined agent image that matches
   the Determined master being used.

-  Documentation: Ship Swagger UI with Determined documentation. The
   ``/swagger-ui`` endpoint has been renamed to ``/docs/rest-api``.

-  Documentation: Add a :ref:`guide on configuring TLS <tls>` in
   Determined.

-  Kubernetes: Add support for configuring memory and CPU requirements
   for the Determined database when installing via the Determined Helm
   Chart.

-  Kubernetes: Add support for configuring the `storageClass
   <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/>`__
   that is used when deploying a database using the Determined Helm
   Chart.

**Bug Fixes**

-  Harness: Do not require the master to present a full TLS certificate
   chain when the certificate is signed by a well-known Certificate
   Authority.

-  Harness: Fix a bug which affected ``TFKerasTrial`` using TensorFlow 2
   with ``gradient_aggregation`` > 1.

-  Master: Fix a bug where the master instance would fail if an
   experiment could not be read from the database.

-  WebUI: Preserve the colors used for multiple metrics on the metric
   chart.

-  WebUI: Fix the ability to cancel a batch of experiments.

-  WebUI: Fix a bug which caused the Experiment Details page to not
   render when the latest validation metric is not available.

Version 0.13.5
==============

**Release Date:** September 30, 2020

**Improvements**

-  Security: Use one TCP port for all incoming connections to the master
   and use TLS for all connections if configured.

   -  **Breaking Change:** The ``http_port`` and ``https_port`` options
      in the master configuration have been replaced by the single
      ``port`` option. The ``security.http`` option is no longer
      accepted; the master can no longer be configured to listen over
      HTTP and HTTPS simultaneously.

-  Security: Support configuring TLS encryption when deploying
   Determined on Kubernetes. For more details please see
   :ref:`install-on-kubernetes`.

-  Agent: Increase default max agent starting and idle timeouts to 20
   minutes and increase max disconnected period from 5 to 10 minutes.

-  Deployment: Add support for ``det-deploy aws`` in the following new
   regions: ``ap-northeast-1``, ``eu-central-1``, ``eu-west-1``,
   ``us-east-2``.

-  Docker: Publish new Docker task containers that upgrade TensorFlow
   versions from 1.15.0 to 1.15.4, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.1.

-  Documentation: Add extra documentation and reorganize examples by use
   case.

-  Documentation: Add a ``tf.layers-in-Estimator`` example.

-  Kubernetes: Add support for users to specify ``initContainers`` and
   ``containers`` as part of their custom pod specs. Please see
   :ref:`custom-pod-specs` for details.

-  Kubernetes: Publish version 0.2.0 of the Determined Helm chart.

-  Native API: Deprecate Native API. Removed related examples and docs.

-  Trials: Remove support for ``TensorpackTrial``.

-  WebUI: Improve polling behavior for experiment and trial details
   pages to avoid hanging indefinitely for very large
   experiments/trials.

**Bug Fixes**

-  Trials: Fix a bug where if only a subset of workers on a machine
   executed the ``on_trial_close()`` ``EstimatorTrial`` callback, the
   container would terminate as soon as one worker exited.

-  Trials: Fix a bug where ``det e create --test`` would succeed when
   there were checkpointing failures.

-  WebUI: Fix the issue of multiple selected rows dissappearing after a
   successful table batch action.

-  WebUI: Remove unused TensorBoard sources column from the task list
   page.

-  WebUI: Fix rendering metrics with the same name on the metric chart.

-  WebUI: Make several fixes to improve select appearance and user
   experience.

-  WebUI: Fix the issue of agent and cluster info not loading on slow
   connections.

-  WebUI: Fix the issue where the chart in the Experiment page does not
   have the metric name in the legend.

Version 0.13.4
==============

**Release Date:** September 16, 2020

**Improvements**

-  Support configuring default values for the task image, Docker pull
   policy, and Docker registry credentials via the
   :ref:`master-configuration` and the :ref:`helm-config`. In previous
   versions of Determined, these values had to be specified on a
   per-task basis (e.g., in the experiment configuration). Per-task
   configuration is still supported and will overwrite the default value
   (if any).

-  Add connection checks for dynamic agents. A dynamically provisioned
   agent will be terminated if it is not actively connected to the
   master for at least five minutes.

-  Emit a warning if ``DistributeConfig`` is specified for an
   ``Estimator``. Configuring an ``Estimator`` via
   ``tf.distribute.Strategy`` can conflict with how Determined performs
   distributed training. With this change, Determined will attempt to
   catch this problem and surface an error message in the experiment
   logs. An ``Estimator`` can still be configured with an empty
   ``DistributeConfig`` without issue.

-  Remove support for ``dataflow_to_tf_dataset`` in
   :class:`~determined.estimator.EstimatorTrial`. Dataflows should be
   wrapped using ``wrap_dataset(shard=False)`` instead.

-  WebUI: Add middle mouse button click detection on tables to open in a
   new tab/page.

-  WebUI: Improve the trial detail metrics view.

   -  Support metrics with non-numeric values.
   -  Default to showing only the searcher metric on initial page load.
   -  Add search capability to the metric select filter. This should
      improve the experience when there are many metrics.
   -  Add support for displaying multiple metrics on the metric chart.

-  WebUI: Move TensorBoard sources from a table column into a separate
   modal.

-  WebUI: Optimize loading of active TensorBoards and notebooks.

**Bug Fixes**

-  Improve handling of certain corner cases where distributed training
   jobs could hang indefinitely.

-  Fix an issue where detecting GPU availability in TensorFlow code
   would cause ``EstimatorTrial`` models to OOM.

-  Fix an issue where accessing logs could create a memory leak.

-  Fix an issue that prevents resuming from checkpoints that contain a
   large number of files.

-  WebUI: Fix an issue where table page sizes were not saved between
   page loads.

-  WebUI: Fix an issue where opening a TensorBoard on an experiment
   would not direct the user to an already running TensorBoard, but
   instead create a new one.

-  WebUI: Fix an issue where batch actions on the experiments table
   would cause rows to disappear.

**Known Issues**

-  WebUI: In the trial detail metrics view, experiments that have both a
   training metric and a validation metric of the same name will not be
   displayed correctly on the metrics chart.

Version 0.13.3
==============

**Release Date:** September 8, 2020

**Bug Fixes**

-  Deployment: Fix a bug where ``det-deploy local cluster-up`` was
   failing.
-  WebUI: Fix a bug where experiment labels were not displayed on the
   experiment list page.
-  WebUI: Fix a bug with decoding API responses because of unexpected
   non-numeric metric values.

Version 0.13.2
==============

**Release Date:** September 3, 2020

**New Features**

-  Support deploying Determined on `Kubernetes
   <https://kubernetes.io/>`__.

   -  Determined workloads run as a collection of pods, which allows
      standard Kubernetes tools for logging, metrics, and tracing to be
      used. Determined is compatible with Kubernetes >= 1.15, including
      managed Kubernetes services such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
      and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

   -  When using Determined with Kubernetes, we currently do not support
      fair-share scheduling, priority scheduling, per-experiment
      weights, or gang-scheduling for distributed training experiments;
      workloads will be scheduled according the behavior of the default
      Kubernetes scheduler.

   -  Users can configure the behavior of the pods that are launched for
      Determined workloads by specifying a :ref:`custom pod spec
      <custom-pod-specs>`. A default pod spec can be configured when
      installing Kubernetes, but a custom pod spec can also be specified
      on a per-task basis (e.g., via the :ref:`environment.pod_spec
      <exp-environment-pod-spec>` field in the experiment configuration
      file).

   -  For more information on using Determined with Kubernetes, see the
      :ref:`documentation <determined-on-kubernetes>`.

-  Support running multiple distributed training jobs on a single agent.

   -  In previous versions of Determined, a distributed training job
      could only be scheduled on an agent if it was configured to use
      all of the GPUs on that agent. In this release, that restriction
      has been lifted: for example, an agent with 8 GPUs can now be used
      to run two 4-GPU distributed training jobs. This feature is
      particularly useful as a way to improve utilization and fair
      resource allocation for smaller clusters.

**Improvements**

-  WebUI: Update primary navigation. The primary navigation is all to
   one side, and is now collapsible to maximize content space.

-  WebUI: Trial details improvements:

   -  Update metrics selector to show the number of metrics selected to
      improve readability.

   -  Add the "Has Checkpoint or Validation" filter.

   -  Persist the "Has Checkpoint or Validation" filter setting across
      all trials, and persist the "Metrics" filter on trials of the same
      experiment.

-  WebUI: Improve table pagination behavior. This will improve
   performance on Determined instances with many experiments.

-  WebUI: Persist the sort order and sort column for the experiments,
   tasks, and trials tables to local storage.

-  WebUI: Improve the default axes' ranges for metrics charts. Also,
   update the range as new data points arrive.

-  Add a warning when the PyTorch LR scheduler incorrectly uses an
   unwrapped optimizer. When using PyTorch with Determined, LR
   schedulers should be constructed using an optimizer that has been
   wrapped via the
   :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext.wrap_optimizer`
   method.

-  Add a reminder to remove ``sys.exit()`` if ``SystemExit`` exception
   is caught.

**Bug Fixes**

-  WebUI: Fix an issue where the recent task list did not apply the
   limit filter properly.
-  Fix Keras and Estimator wrapping functions not returning the original
   objects when exporting checkpoints.
-  Fix progress reporting for ``adaptive_asha`` searches that contain
   failed trials.
-  Fix an issue that was causing OOM errors for some distributed
   ``EstimatorTrial`` experiments.

Version 0.13.1
==============

**Release Date:** August 31, 2020

**Bug Fixes**

-  Database migration: Fix a bug with a database migration in Determined
   version 0.13.0 which caused it to run slow and backfill incorrect
   values. Users on Determined versions 0.12.13 or earlier are
   recommended to upgrade to version 0.13.1. Users already on version
   0.13.0 should upgrade to version 0.13.1 as usual.

-  Tensorboard: Fix a bug that prevents Tensorboards from experiments
   with old experiment configuration versions from being loaded.

-  WebUI: Fix an API response decoding issue on React where a null
   checkpoint resource was unhandled and could prevent trial detail page
   from rendering.

-  WebUI: Fix an issue where terminated Tensorboard and notebook tasks
   were rendered as openable.

Version 0.13.0
==============

**Release Date:** August 20, 2020

This release of Determined introduces several significant new features
and modifications to existing features. When upgrading from a prior
release of Determined, users should pay particular attention to the
following changes:

-  The concept of "steps" has been removed from the CLI, WebUI, APIs,
   and configuration files. Before upgrading, **terminate all active and
   paused experiments** (e.g., via ``det experiment cancel`` or ``det
   experiment kill``). The format of the experiment config file has
   changed -- configuration files that worked with previous versions of
   Determined will need to be updated to work with Determined >= 0.13.0.
   For more details, see the notes below or the :ref:`migration guide
   <migration-guide_remove-steps>`.

-  The WebUI has been partially rewritten, moving several components
   that were implemented in Elm to now being written in React and
   TypeScript. As part of this change, many improvements to the
   performance, appearance, and usability of the WebUI have been made.
   For more details, see the list of changes below. Please notify the
   Determined team of any regressions in functionality.

-  The usability of the ``det shell`` feature has been significantly
   enhanced. As part of this change, the way in which arguments to ``det
   shell`` are parsed has changed; see details below.

*We recommend taking a backup of the database before upgrading
Determined.*

**New Features**

-  Allow trial containers to connect to the master using TLS.

-  Allow agent's TLS verification to skip verification or use a custom
   certificate for the master.

-  For :class:`~determined.keras.TFKerasTrial` and
   :class:`~determined.estimator.EstimatorTrial`, add support for
   disabling automatic sharding of the training dataset when doing
   distributed training. When wrapping a dataset via
   ``context.wrap_dataset``, users can now pass ``shard_dataset=False``.
   If this is done, users are responsible for splitting their dataset in
   such a manner that every GPU (rank) sees unique data.

**Improvements**

-  **Remove Steps from the UX:** Remove the concept of a "step" from the
   CLI, WebUI, and configuration files. Add new configuration settings
   to allow settings previously in terms of steps to be configured
   instead in terms of records, batches or epochs. See the
   :ref:`migration guide <migration-guide_remove-steps>` for details on
   migrating from the old configuration to the new configuration.

   -  Many configuration settings can now be set in terms of records,
      batches or epochs. For example, a single searcher can be
      configured to run for 100 records by setting ``max_length:
      {records: 100}``, 100 batches by setting ``max_length: {batches:
      100}``, or 100 epochs by setting ``records_per_epoch`` at the root
      of the config and ``max_length: {epochs: 100}``.

   -  A new configuration setting, ``records_per_epoch``, is added that
      must be specified when any quantity is configured in terms of
      epochs.

   -  **Breaking Change:** For single, random and grid searchers
      ``searcher.max_steps`` has been replaced by
      ``searcher.max_length``

   -  **Breaking Change:** For ASHA based searchers,
      ``searcher.target_trial_steps`` and ``searcher.step_budget`` has
      been replaced by ``searcher.max_length`` and ``searcher.budget``,
      respectively.

   -  **Breaking Change:** For PBT, ``searcher.steps_per_round`` has
      been replaced by ``searcher.length_per_round``.

   -  **Breaking Change:** For all experiments, the names for
      ``min_validation_period`` and ``min_checkpoint_period`` are
      unchanged but they are now configured in terms of records, batches
      or epochs.

-  **Shell Mode Improvements:** Determined supports launching
   GPU-attached terminal sessions via ``det shell``. This release
   includes several changes to improve the usability of this feature,
   including:

   -  The ``determined`` and ``determined-cli`` Python packages are now
      automatically installed inside containers launched by ``det
      shell``. Any user-defined environment variables for the task image
      will be passed into the ssh sessions opened via ``det shell
      start`` or ``det shell open``.

   -  ``det shell`` should now work correctly in "host" networking mode.

   -  ``det shell`` should now work correctly with dynamic agents and in
      cloud environments.

   -  **Breaking Change:** Change how additional arguments to ``ssh``
      are passed through ``det shell start`` and ``det shell open``.
      Previously they were passed as a single string, like ``det shell
      open SHELL_ID --ssh-opt '-X -Y -o SomeSetting="some string"'``,
      but now the ``--ssh-opt`` has been removed and all extra
      positional arguments are passed through without requiring
      double-layers of quoting, like ``det shell open SHELL_ID -- -X -Y
      -o SomeSetting="some string"`` (note the use of ``--`` to indicate
      all following arguments are positional arguments).

-  **WebUI changes**

   -  Tasks List: ``/det/tasks``

      -  Consolidate notebooks, tensorboards, shells, commands into
         single list page.

      -  Add type filter to control which task types to display. By
         default all task types are shown when none of the types are
         selected.

      -  Add type column with iconography to train users to familiarize
         task types with visual indicators.

      -  Convert State filter from multi-select to single-select.

      -  Convert actions from expanded buttons to overflow menu (triple
         vertical dots).

      -  Move notebook launch buttons to task list from notebook list
         page.

      -  Add pagination support that auto turns on when entries extend
         beyond 10 entries.

      -  Add list of TensorBoard sources in a table Source column.

   -  Experiment List: ``/det/experiments``

      -  State filter converted from multi-select to single-select.
      -  Convert actions from expanded buttons to overflow menu (triple
         vertical dots).
      -  Batch operation logic change to available if the action can be
         applied to any of the selected experiments
      -  Add pagination support that auto turns on when entries extend
         beyond 10 entries.

   -  Experiment Detail: ``/det/experiments/<id>``

      -  Implement charting with Plotly with zooming capability.

      -  Trial table paginates on the WebUI side in preparation for API
         pagination in the near future.

      -  Convert steps to batches in trials table and metric chart.

      -  Update continue trial flow to use batches, epochs or records.

Version 0.12.13
===============

**Release Date:** August 6, 2020

**New Features**

-  **Model Registry:** Determined now includes a built-in model
   registry, which makes it easy to organize trained models by providing
   versioning and labeling tools. See :ref:`organizing-models` to get
   started.

-  **New PyTorch API:** Add a new version of the PyTorch API that is
   more flexible and supports deep learning experiments that use
   multiple models, optimizers, and LR schedulers. The old API is still
   supported but is now deprecated and will be removed in a future
   release. See the :ref:`migration guide
   <migration-guide-flexible-primitives>` for details on updating your
   PyTorch model code. *Deprecated methods will be supported until at
   least the next minor release.*

   -  The new API supports PyTorch code that uses multiple models,
      optimizers, and LR schedulers. In your trial class, you should
      instantiate those objects and wrap them with
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext.wrap_model`,
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext.wrap_optimizer`,
      and
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext.wrap_lr_scheduler`
      in the constructor of your PyTorch trial class. The previous API
      methods ``build_model``, ``optimizer``, and
      ``create_lr_scheduler`` in
      :class:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial` are now deprecated.

   -  Support customizing forward and backward passes in
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial.train_batch`. Gradient
      clipping should now be done by passing a function to the
      ``clip_grads`` argument of
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext.step_optimizer`.
      The callback ``on_before_optimizer_step`` is now deprecated.

   -  Configuring automatic mixed precision (AMP) in PyTorch should now
      be done by calling
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext.configure_apex_amp`
      in the constructor of your PyTorch trial class. The
      ``optimizations.mixed_precision`` experiment configuration key is
      now deprecated.

   -  The ``model`` arguments to
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial.train_batch`,
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial.evaluate_batch`, and
      :meth:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial.evaluate_full_dataset` are
      now deprecated.

-  **More Efficient Hyperparameter Search:** This release introduces a
   new hyperparameter search method, ``adaptive_asha``. This is based on
   an asynchronous version of the ``adaptive`` algorithm, and should
   enable large searches to find high-quality hyperparameter
   configurations more quickly. See the :ref:`documentation
   <topic-guides_hp-tuning-det_adaptive-asha>` and the `associated paper
   <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.05934.pdf>`__ for more information.

**Improvements**

-  Allow proxy environment variables to be set in the agent config. See
   :ref:`environment-variables` for more information.

-  Preserve random state for PyTorch experiments when checkpointing and
   restoring.

-  Remove ``determined.pytorch.reset_parameters()``. This should have no
   effect except when using highly customized ``nn.Module``
   implementations.

-  WebUI: Show total number of resources in the cluster resource charts.

-  Add support for Nvidia T4 GPUs.

-  ``det-deploy``: Add support for ``g4`` instance types on AWS.

-  Upgrade Nvidia drivers on the default AWS and GCP images from
   ``410.104`` to ``450.51.05``.

**Bug Fixes**

-  Fix an issue with the SHA searcher that could cause searches to stop
   making progress without finishing.
-  Fix an issue where ``$HOME`` was not properly set in notebooks
   running in nonroot containers.
-  Fix an issue where killed experiments had their state reset to the
   latest checkpoint.
-  Randomize the notebook listening port to avoid port binding issues in
   host mode.

Version 0.12.12
===============

**Release Date:** July 22, 2020

**Improvements**

-  Remove support for ``on_train_step_begin`` and ``on_train_step_end``,
   deprecate ``on_validation_step_end``, and introduce new callback
   ``on_validation_end`` with same functionality. Add helper methods
   ``is_epoch_start`` and ``is_epoch_end`` to PyTorch context.

-  Add a new API to support custom reducers in ``EstimatorTrial``. See
   :ref:``estimator-trial`` for details.

-  CLI: Add the ``register_version`` command for registering a new
   version of a model.

-  CLI: Add a ``--head`` option when printing trial logs.

-  WebUI: Make it possible to launch TensorBoard from experiment
   dashboard cards.

**Bug Fixes**

-  Fix distributed training and Determined shell with non-root
   containers. The default task environments now include a user plugin
   to support running containers with arbitrary non-root users. Custom
   images based on the latest default task environments should also
   work.

-  Fix convergence issue for TF 2 multi-GPU models. Change default TF1
   version from 1.14 to 1.15.

-  Fix issue affecting TensorFlow TensorBoard outputs.

-  Use local log line IDs for trial logs.

-  CLI: Improve the CLI's custom TLS certificate handling with
   non-self-signed certs.

-  WebUI: Fix a parsing problem with task start times.

-  WebUI: Fix log viewer timestamp copy/paste.

**Known Issues**

-  WebUI: Older trial logs are not loaded by scrolling to the top of the
   page.

Version 0.12.11
===============

**Release Date:** July 8, 2020

-  Add logging to console in test mode for the Native API when using
   :class:`determined.experimental.create`.

-  Improve reliability of saving checkpoints to GCS in the presence of
   transient network errors.

-  Add `an example
   <https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/tree/master/examples/experimental/trial/unets_tf_keras>`__
   using TensorFlow's *Image Segmentation via UNet* tutorial.

-  WebUI: Improve trial log rendering performance.

-  WebUI: Fix an issue where cluster utilization was displayed
   incorrectly.

-  WebUI: Fix an issue where active experiments and commands would not
   appear on the dashboard.

-  WebUI: Fix an issue where having telemetry enabled with an invalid
   key would cause the WebUI to render incorrectly.

Version 0.12.10
===============

**Release Date:** June 26, 2020

**Improvements**

-  WebUI: Add a dedicated page for master logs at ``/det/logs``.
-  WebUI: Provide a Swagger UI for exploring the Determined REST API.
   This can be accessed via the API link on the WebUI.
-  WebUI: Default the Experiments view list length to 25 entries. More
   entries can be shown as needed.
-  WebUI: Improve detection of situations where the WebUI version
   doesn't match the master version as a result of browser caching.
-  CLI: Improve performance when retrieving trial logs.
-  CLI: Add the ``det user rename`` command for administrators to change
   the username of existing users.
-  Expand documentation on :ref:`use-trained-models` by including
   checkpoint metadata management.
-  Reorganize examples by splitting :ref:`model-definitions_trial-api`
   examples into separate folders.

**Bug Fixes**

-  Allow ``det-deploy local agent-up`` to work with remote masters.
-  Ensure network failures during checkpoint upload do not unrecoverably
   break the associated trial.
-  Ensure ``shared_fs`` checkpoint storage is usable for non-root
   containers for some ``host_path`` values.
-  Fix a timeout issue that affected large (40+ machines) distributed
   experiments.
-  Ensure the CLI can make secure connections to the master.
-  Fix an issue that affected multi-GPU in ``PyTorchTrial`` with mixed
   precision enabled.
-  Add a timeout to trial containers to ensure they are terminated
   promptly.

Version 0.12.7
==============

**Release Date:** June 11, 2020

-  **Breaking Change:** Gradient clipping for PyTorchTrial should now be
   specified via :class:`determined.pytorch.PyTorchCallback` via the
   ``on_before_optimizer_step()`` method instead of being specified via
   the experiment configuration. Determined provides two built-in
   callbacks for gradient clipping:
   :class:`determined.pytorch.ClipGradsL2Norm` and
   :class:`determined.pytorch.ClipGradsL2Value`.

-  Add a ``metadata`` field to checkpoints. Checkpoints can now have
   arbitrary key-value pairs associated with them. Metadata can be
   added, queried, and removed via a :class:`Python API
   <determined.experimental.Checkpoint>`. See the :ref:`documentation
   <store-checkpoint-metadata>` for details.

-  Add support for Keras callbacks that stop training early, including
   the `official EarlyStopping callback
   <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping>`__.
   When a stop is requested, Determined will finish the training (or
   validation) step we are in, checkpoint, and terminate the trial.

-  Add support for Estimator callbacks that stop training early,
   including the official `stop_if_no_decrease_hook
   <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/experimental/stop_if_no_decrease_hook>`__.
   When a stop is requested, Determined will finish the training (or
   validation) step we are in, checkpoint, and terminate the trial.

-  Add support for model code that stops training of a trial
   programmatically.

   -  We recommend using the official Keras callbacks or Estimator hooks
      if you are using those frameworks. For PyTorch, you can request
      that training be stopped by calling
      :meth:`~determined.TrialContext.set_stop_requested` from a PyTorch
      callback. When a stop is requested, Determined will finish the
      current training or validation step, checkpoint, and terminate the
      trial. Trials that are stopped early are considered to be
      "completed" (e.g., in the WebUI and CLI).

-  More robust error handling for hyperparameter searches where one of
   the trials in the search encounters a persistent error.

   -  Determined will automatically restart the execution of trials that
      fail within an experiment, up to ``max_restart`` failures. After
      this point, any trials that fail are marked as "errored" but the
      hyperparameter search itself is allowed to continue running. This
      is particularly useful when some parts of the hyperparameter space
      result in models that cannot be trained successfully (e.g., the
      search explores a range of batch sizes and some of those batch
      sizes cause GPU OOM errors). An experiment can complete
      successfully as long as at least one of the trials within it
      completes successfully.

-  Support multi-GPU training for TensorFlow 2 models that use
   ``IndexedSlices`` for model parameters.

-  ``NaN`` values in training and validation metrics are now treated as
   errors.

   -  This will result in restarting the trial from the most recently
      checkpoint if it has been restarted fewer than ``max_restarts``
      times. Previously, ``NaN`` values were converted to the maximum
      floating point value.

-  Preserve the last used user name on the log-in page.

-  Add ``on_trial_close`` method to
   :class:`determined.estimator.RunHook`. Use this for post-trial
   cleanup.

-  Finalize gradient communication prior to applying gradient clipping
   in PyTorchTrial when perfoming multi-GPU training.

-  WebUI: Add pause, activate, and cancel actions to dashboard tasks.

-  Add a ``det-nobody`` user (with UID 65533) to default images. This
   provides an out-of-the-box option for running non-privileged
   containers with a working home directory.

Version 0.12.5
==============

**Release Date:** May 27, 2020

-  **Breaking Change:** Alter command-line options for controlling test
   mode and local mode. Test experiments on the cluster were previously
   created with ``det e create --test-mode ...`` but now should be
   created with ``det e create --test ...``. Local testing is started
   with ``det e create --test --local ...``. Fully local training
   (meaning ``--local`` without ``--test``) is not yet supported.

-  Add support for TensorFlow 2.2.

-  Add support for post-checkpoint callbacks in
   :class:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial`.

-  Add support for checkpoint hooks in
   :class:`~determined.estimator.EstimatorTrial`.

-  Add support for TensorBoard backed by S3-compliant APIs that are not
   AWS S3.

-  Add generic callback support for PyTorch.

-  TensorBoards now shut down after 10 minutes if metrics are
   unavailable.

-  Update to NCCL 2.6.4 for distributed training.

-  Update minimum required task environment version to 0.4.0.

-  Fix Native API training one step rather than one batch when using
   TensorFlow Keras and Estimator.

-  CLI: Add support for producing CSV and JSON output to ``det slot
   list`` and ``det agent list``.

-  CLI: Include the number of containers on each agent in the output of
   ``det agent list``.

Version 0.12.4
==============

**Release Date:** May 14, 2020

-  **Breaking Change:** Users are no longer automatically logged in as
   the "determined" user. Refer to :ref:`users` for more details.

-  Support multi-slot notebooks. The number of slots per notebook cannot
   exceed the size of the largest available agent. The number of slots
   to use for a notebook task can be configured when the notebook is
   launched: ``det notebook start --config resources.slots=2``

-  Support fetching the configuration of a running master via the CLI
   (``det master config``).

-  Authentication sessions now expire after 7 days.

-  Improve log messages for ``tf.keras`` trial callbacks.

-  Add ``nvidia-container-toolkit`` support.

-  Fix an error in the experimental ``bert_glue_pytorch`` example.

-  The ``tf.keras`` examples for the Native and Trial APIs now refer to
   the same model.

-  Add a topic guide explaining Determined's approach to
   :ref:`elastic-infra-index`.

   :class:`~determined.experimental.TrialReference`, and
   :class:`~determined.experimental.Checkpoint` objects.

-  TensorBoard logs now appear under the ``storage_path`` for
   ``shared_fs`` checkpoint configurations.

-  Allow commands, notebooks, shells, and TensorBoards to be killed
   before they are scheduled.

-  Print container exit reason in trial logs.

-  Choose a better default for the ``--tail`` option of command logs.

-  Add REST API endpoints for trials.

-  Support the execution of a startup script inside the agent docker
   container

-  Master and agent Docker containers will have the 'unless-stopped'
   restart policy by default when using ``det-deploy local``.

-  Prevent the ``det trial logs -f`` command from waiting for too long
   after the trial being watched reaches a terminal state.

-  Fix bug where logs disappear when an image is pulled.

-  Fix bug that affected the use of
   :class:`~determined.pytorch.LRScheduler` in
   :class:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial` for multi-GPU training.

-  Fix bug after master restart where some errored experiments would
   show progress indicators.

-  Fix ordering of steps from ``det trial describe --json``.

-  Docs: Added topic guide for effective distributed training.

-  Docs: Reorganize install documentation.

-  UI: Move the authenticated user to the top of the users list filter
   on the dashboard, right after "All".

Version 0.12.2
==============

**Release Date:** April 21, 2020

**Breaking Changes**

-  Rename PEDL to Determined. The canonical way to import it is via
   ``import determined as det``.

-  Reorganize source code. The frameworks module was removed, and each
   framework's submodules were collapsed into the main framework module.
   For example:

   -  ``det.frameworks.pytorch.pytorch_trial.PyTorchTrial`` is now
      ``det.pytorch.PyTorchTrial``
   -  ``det.frameworks.pytorch.data.DataLoader`` is now
      ``det.pytorch.DataLoader``
   -  ``det.frameworks.pytorch.checkpoint.load`` is now
      ``det.pytorch.load``
   -  ``det.frameworks.pytorch.util.reset_parameters`` is now
      ``det.pytorch.reset_parameters``
   -  ``det.frameworks.keras.tf_keras_trial.TFKerasTrial`` is now
      ``det.keras.TFKerasTrial``
   -  ``det.frameworks.tensorflow.estimator_trial.EstimatorTrial`` is
      now ``det.estimator.EstimatorTrial``
   -  ``det.frameworks.tensorpack.tensorpack_trial`` is now
      ``det.tensorpack.TensorpackTrial``
   -  ``det.frameworks.util`` and ``det.frameworks.pytorch.util`` have
      been removed entirely

-  Unify all plugin functions under the Trial class.
   ``make_data_loaders`` has been moved to two functions that should be
   implemented as part of the Trial class. For example,
   :class:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial` data loaders should now be
   implemented in ``build_training_data_loader()`` and
   ``build_validation_data_loader()`` in the trial definition. Please
   see updated examples and documentation for changes in each framework.

-  Trial classes are now required to define a constructor function. The
   signature of the constructor function is:

   .. code:: python

      def __init__(self, context) -> None:
          ...

   where ``context`` is an instance of the new ``det.TrialContext``
   class. This new object is the primary mechanism for querying
   information about the system. Some of its methods include:

   -  ``get_hparam(name)``: get a hyperparameter by name

   -  ``get_trial_id()``: get the trial ID being trained

   -  ``get_experiment_config()``: get the experiment config for this
      experiment

   -  ``get_per_slot_batch_size()``: get the batch size appropriate for
      training (which will be adjusted from the ``global_batch_size``
      hyperparameter in distributed training experiments)

   -  ``get_global_batch_size()``: get the effective batch size (which
      differs from per-slot batch size in distributed training
      experiments)

   -  ``distributed.get_rank()``: get the unique process rank (one
      process per slot)

   -  ``distributed.get_local_rank()``: get a unique process rank within
      the agent

   -  ``distributed.get_size()``: get the number of slots

   -  ``distributed.get_num_agents``: get the number of agents
      (machines) being used

-  The ``global_batch_size`` hyperparameter is required (that is, a
   hyperparameter with this name must be specified in the configuration
   of every experiment). Previously, the hyperparameter ``batch_size``
   was required and was manipulated automatically for distributed
   training. Now ``global_batch_size`` will not be manipulated; users
   should train based on ``context.get_per_slot_batch_size()``. See
   :ref:`multi-gpu-training` for more context.

-  Remove ``download_data()``. If users wish to download data at
   runtime, they should make sure that each process (one process per
   slot) downloads to a unique location. This can be accomplished by
   appending ``context.get_rank()`` to the download path.

-  Remove ``det.trial_controller.util.get_rank()`` and
   ``det.trial_controller.util.get_container_gpus()``. Use
   ``context.distributed.get_rank()`` and
   ``context.distributed.get_num_agents()`` instead.

**General Improvements**

-  ``tf.data.Dataset`` is now supported as input for all versions of
   TensorFlow (1.14, 1.15, 2.0, 2.1) for TFKerasTrial and
   EstimatorTrial. Please note that Determined currently does not
   support checkpointing ``tf.data.Dataset`` inputs. Therefore, when
   resuming training, it resumes from the start of the dataset. Model
   weights are loaded correctly as always.

-  ``TFKerasTrial`` now supports five different types of inputs:

   #. A tuple ``(x_train, y_train)`` of NumPy arrays. ``x_train`` must
      be a NumPy array (or array-like), a list of arrays (in case the
      model has multiple inputs), or a dict mapping input names to the
      corresponding array, if the model has named inputs. ``y_train``
      should be a NumPy array.

   #. A tuple ``(x_train, y_train, sample_weights)`` of NumPy arrays.

   #. A `tf.data.Dataset
      <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset>`__
      returning a tuple of either ``(inputs, targets)`` or ``(inputs,
      targets, sample_weights)``.

   #. A `keras.utils.Sequence
      <https://tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/Sequence>`__
      returning a tuple of either ``(inputs, targets)`` or ``(inputs,
      targets, sample weights)``.

   #. A ``det.keras.SequenceAdapter`` returning a tuple of either
      ``(inputs, targets)`` or ``(inputs, targets, sample weights)``.

-  PyTorch trial checkpoints no longer save in MLflow's MLmodel format.

-  The ``det trial download`` command now accepts ``-o`` to save a
   checkpoint to a specific path. PyTorch checkpoints can then be loaded
   from a specified local filesystem path.

-  Allow the agent to read configuration values from a YAML file.

-  Include experiment ID in the downloaded trial logs.

-  Display checkpoint storage location in the checkpoint info modal for
   trials and experiments.

-  Preserve recent tasks' filter preferences in the WebUI.

-  Add task name to ``det slot list`` command output.

-  Model definitions are now downloaded as compressed tarfiles (.tar.gz)
   instead of zipfiles (.zip).

-  ``startup-hook.sh`` is now executed in the same directory as the
   model definition.

-  Rename ``projects`` to ``examples`` in the Determined repository.

-  Improve documentation:

   -  Add documentation page on the lifecycle of an experiment.
   -  Add how-to and topic guides for multi-GPU (both for single-machine
      parallel and multi-machine) training.
   -  Add a topic guide on best practices for writing model definitions.

-  Fix bug that occasionally caused multi-machine training to hang on
   initialization.

-  Fix bug that prevented ``TensorpackTrial`` from successfully loading
   checkpoints.

-  Fix a bug in ``TFKerasTrial`` where runtime errors could cause the
   trial to hang or would silently drop the stack trace produced by
   Keras.

-  Fix trial lifecycle bugs for containers that exit during the pulling
   phase.

-  Fix bug that led to some distributed trials timing out.

-  Fix bug that caused ``tf.keras`` trials to fail in the multi-GPU
   setting when using an optimizer specified by its name.

-  Fix bug in the CLI for downloading model definitions.

-  Fix performance issues for experiments with very large numbers of
   trials.

-  Optimize performance for scheduling large hyperparameter searches.

-  Add configuration for telemetry in ``master.yaml``.

-  Add a utility function for initializing a trial class for development
   (det.create_trial_instance)

-  Add `security.txt <https://securitytxt.org/>`__.

-  Add ``det.estimator.load()`` to load TensorFlow Estimator
   ``saved_model`` checkpoints into memory.

-  Ensure AWS EC2 keypair exists in account before creating the
   CloudFormation stack.

-  Add support for gradient aggregation in Keras trials for TensorFlow
   2.1.

-  Add TrialReference and Checkpoint experimental APIs for exporting and
   loading checkpoints.

-  Improve performance when starting many tasks simultaneously.

**Web Improvements**

-  Add dropdown action menu for killing and archiving recent tasks on
   the dashboard.
-  Add telemetry for web interactions.
-  Fix an issue around cluster utilization status showing as "No Agent"
   for a brief moment during initial load.
-  Add Ace editor to attributions list.
-  Set UI preferences based on the logged-in user.
-  Fix an issue where the indicated user filter was not applied to the
   displayed tasks.
-  Improve error messaging for failed actions.
