Version 0.12.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Release Date:** April 21, 2020

**Breaking Changes**

- Rename PEDL to Determined. The canonical way to import it is via ``import determined as det``.

- Reorganize source code. The frameworks module was removed, and each framework's submodules were collapsed into the main framework module. For example:

  - ``det.frameworks.pytorch.pytorch_trial.PyTorchTrial`` is now ``det.pytorch.PyTorchTrial``
  - ``det.frameworks.pytorch.data.DataLoader`` is now ``det.pytorch.DataLoader``
  - ``det.frameworks.pytorch.checkpoint.load`` is now ``det.pytorch.load``
  - ``det.frameworks.pytorch.util.reset_parameters`` is now ``det.pytorch.reset_parameters``
  - ``det.frameworks.keras.tf_keras_trial.TFKerasTrial`` is now ``det.keras.TFKerasTrial``
  - ``det.frameworks.tensorflow.estimator_trial.EstimatorTrial`` is now ``det.estimator.EstimatorTrial``
  - ``det.frameworks.tensorpack.tensorpack_trial`` is now ``det.tensorpack.TensorpackTrial``
  - ``det.frameworks.util`` and ``det.frameworks.pytorch.util`` have been removed entirely

- Unify all plugin functions under the Trial class. ``make_data_loaders`` has been moved to two functions that should be implemented as part of the Trial class. For example, :class:`~determined.pytorch.PyTorchTrial` data loaders should now be implemented in ``build_training_data_loader()`` and ``build_validation_data_loader()`` in the trial definition. Please see updated examples and documentation for changes in each framework.

- Trial classes are now required to define a constructor function. The signature of the constructor function is:

  .. code:: python

     def __init__(self, context) -> None:

  where ``context`` is an instance of the new ``det.TrialContext`` class. This new object is the primary mechanism for querying information about the system. Some of its methods include:

  - ``get_hparam(name)``: get a hyperparameter by name
  - ``get_trial_id()``: get the trial ID being trained
  - ``get_experiment_config()``: get the experiment config for this experiment
  - ``get_per_slot_batch_size()``: get the batch size appropriate for training (which will be adjusted from the ``global_batch_size`` hyperparameter in distributed training experiments)
  - ``get_global_batch_size()``: get the effective batch size (which differs from per-slot batch size in distributed training experiments)
  - ``distributed.get_rank()``: get the unique process rank (one process per slot)
  - ``distributed.get_local_rank()``: get a unique process rank within the agent
  - ``distributed.get_size()``: get the number of slots
  - ``distributed.get_num_agents``: get the number of agents (machines) being used

- The ``global_batch_size`` hyperparameter is required (that is, a hyperparameter with this name must be specified in the configuration of every experiment). Previously, the hyperparameter ``batch_size`` was required and was manipulated automatically for distributed training. Now ``global_batch_size`` will not be manipulated; users should train based on ``context.get_per_slot_batch_size()``. See :ref:`multi-gpu-training` for more context.

- Remove ``download_data()``. If users wish to download data at runtime, they should make sure that each process (one process per slot) downloads to a unique location. This can be accomplished by appending ``context.get_rank()`` to the download path.

- Remove ``det.trial_controller.util.get_rank()`` and ``det.trial_controller.util.get_container_gpus()``. Use ``context.distributed.get_rank()`` and ``context.distributed.get_num_agents()`` instead.

**General Improvements**

- ``tf.data.Dataset`` is now supported as input for all versions of TensorFlow (1.14, 1.15, 2.0, 2.1) for TFKerasTrial and EstimatorTrial. Please note that Determined currently does not support checkpointing ``tf.data.Dataset`` inputs. Therefore, when resuming training, it resumes from the start of the dataset. Model weights are loaded correctly as always.

- ``TFKerasTrial`` now supports five different types of inputs:

  1. A tuple ``(x_train, y_train)`` of NumPy arrays. ``x_train`` must be a NumPy array (or array-like), a list of arrays (in case the model has multiple inputs), or a dict mapping input names to the corresponding array, if the model has named inputs. ``y_train`` should be a NumPy array.

  2. A tuple ``(x_train, y_train, sample_weights)`` of NumPy arrays.

  3. A `tf.data.Dataset <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset>`__ returning a tuple of either ``(inputs, targets)`` or ``(inputs, targets, sample_weights)``.

  4. A `keras.utils.Sequence <https://tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/Sequence>`__ returning a tuple of either ``(inputs, targets)`` or ``(inputs, targets, sample weights)``.

  5. A ``det.keras.SequenceAdapter`` returning a tuple of either ``(inputs, targets)`` or ``(inputs, targets, sample weights)``.

- PyTorch trial checkpoints no longer save in MLflow's MLmodel format.

- The ``det trial download`` command now accepts ``-o`` to save a checkpoint to a specific path. PyTorch checkpoints can then be loaded from a specified local filesystem path.

- Allow the agent to read configuration values from a YAML file.

- Include experiment ID in the downloaded trial logs.

- Display checkpoint storage location in the checkpoint info modal for trials and experiments.

- Preserve recent tasks' filter preferences in the WebUI.

- Add task name to ``det slot list`` command output.

- Model definitions are now downloaded as compressed tarfiles (.tar.gz) instead of zipfiles (.zip).

- ``startup-hook.sh`` is now executed in the same directory as the model definition.

- Rename ``projects`` to ``examples`` in the Determined repository.

- Improve documentation:

  - Add documentation page on the lifecycle of an experiment.
  - Add how-to and topic guides for multi-GPU (both for single-machine parallel and multi-machine) training.
  - Add a topic guide on best practices for writing model definitions.

- Fix bug that occasionally caused multi-machine training to hang on initialization.

- Fix bug that prevented ``TensorpackTrial`` from successfully loading checkpoints.

- Fix a bug in ``TFKerasTrial`` where runtime errors could cause the trial to hang or would silently drop the stack trace produced by Keras.

- Fix trial lifecycle bugs for containers that exit during the pulling phase.

- Fix bug that led to some distributed trials timing out.

- Fix bug that caused ``tf.keras`` trials to fail in the multi-GPU setting when using an optimizer specified by its name.

- Fix bug in the CLI for downloading model definitions.

- Fix performance issues for experiments with very large numbers of trials.

- Optimize performance for scheduling large hyperparameter searches.

- Add configuration for telemetry in ``master.yaml``.

- Add a utility function for initializing a trial class for development (det.create_trial_instance)

- Add `security.txt <https://securitytxt.org/>`__.

- Add ``det.estimator.load()`` to load TensorFlow Estimator ``saved_model`` checkpoints into memory.

- Ensure AWS EC2 keypair exists in account before creating the CloudFormation stack.

- Add support for gradient aggregation in Keras trials for TensorFlow 2.1.

- Add TrialReference and Checkpoint experimental APIs for exporting and loading checkpoints.

- Improve performance when starting many tasks simultaneously.

**Web Improvements**

- Improve discoverability of dashboard actions.

- Add dropdown action menu for killing and archiving recent tasks on the dashboard.

- Add telemetry for web interactions.

- Fix an issue around cluster utilization status showing as "No Agent" for a brief moment during initial load.

- Add Ace editor to attributions list.

- Set UI preferences based on the logged-in user.

- Fix an issue where the indicated user filter was not applied to the displayed tasks.

- Improve error messaging for failed actions.
