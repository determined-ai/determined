 Job Queue Management
######################

Job queue management extends scheduler functionality to offer better visibility and control over
scheduling decisions. It does this by using the *job queue*, which provides information about job
ordering and which jobs are queued, and by permitting dynamic job modification. Job queue management
shows all submitted jobs and job states and lets you modify configuration options, including
priority, queue position, and resource pool membership.

Queue management is available to the fair share, priority, and Kubernetes preemption schedulers.

To manage job queues, navigate to the WebUI **Job Queue** section or use the ``det job`` set of CLI
commands.

***********************
 Job Queue Constraints
***********************

The following constraints are associated with using the job queue to modify jobs:

-  The priority and fair share fields are mutually exclusive. The priority field is active only for
   the priority scheduler and the fair share field is active only for the fair share scheduler. Both
   fields cannot be active simultaneously.

-  The CLI ``ahead-of`` and ``behind-of`` options and the WebUI **Move to Top** operation are
   available only for the priority scheduler and are not available for the fair share scheduler.
   These operations are not yet fully supported for the Kubernetes priority scheduler.

-  The change resource pool operation can only be performed on experiments. To change the resource
   pool of other tasks, cancel the task and resubmit it.

-  Changing priority in Kubernetes always implicitly cancels the job, including when the job
   priority is increased. Priority change in Kubernetes is limited to experiments.

-  Changing resource pools is not available on Kubernetes because it does not currently support
   multiple resource pools.

************
 Job States
************

Queued jobs can be in the ``Queued`` or ``Scheduled`` state.

+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| State         | Description                                                           |
+===============+=======================================================================+
| ``Queued``    | Job received but resources not allocated.                             |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``Scheduled`` | Scheduled to run or running, and resources might have been allocated. |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Completed or errored jobs are not counted as active and are omitted from the queued job list.

********************
 View the Job Queue
********************

You can view the job queue using the CLI or WebUI. In the WebUI, click the **Job Queue** tab. In the
CLI, use one of the following commands:

.. code:: bash

   $ det job list

or

.. code:: bash

   $ det job ls

These commands show the default resource pool queue. To view other resource pool queues, use the
``--resource-pool`` option, specifying the pool:

.. code:: bash

   $ det job list --resource-pool compute-pool

For more information about the CLI options, see the CLI documentation or use the ``det job list -h``
command.

The WebUI and the CLI display a results table ordered by scheduling order. The scheduling order does
not represent the job priority. In addition to job order, the listing shows:

+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Job Property  | Description                                                                  |

 Modify the Job Queue
**********************

The job queue can be changed in the WebUI **Job Queue** section or by using the CLI ``det job
update`` command. You can make changes on a per-job basis by selecting a job and a job operation.
Operations include:

-  changing job priorities for agent and Kubernetes priority scheduler
-  changing weights for agent resource manager using the fair share scheduler
-  changing the order of queued jobs
-  changing resource pools

WebUI Method
============

To use the WebUI to modify the job:

#. Go to the **Job Queue** section.
#. Find the job to modify.
#. Click the three dots in the right-most column of the job.
#. Find and click the **Manage Job** option.
#. Make the change you want on the pop-up page, and click **OK**.

CLI Method
==========

To use the CLI to modify the job queue, use the ``det job update`` command. For more information,
run ``det job update --help`` command.

Examples:

.. code:: bash

   $ det job update jobID --priority 10
   $ det job update jobID --resource-pool compute-pool
   $ det job update jobID --ahead-of jobID-2

The example changes the ``jobID`` job priority to ``10``, the resource pool of the job to
``compute-pool``, and moves ``jobID`` ahead of job ``jobID-2`` in the queue. Currently running jobs
with a priority lower than and including the ``jobID-2`` priority can be preempted to run the newly
promoted ``jobID`` job.

To update a job in batch, use the ``update-batch`` argument:

.. code:: bash

   $ det job update-batch job1.priority=1 job2.resource-pool="compute" job3.ahead-of=job1

Example CLI workflow:

.. code:: bash

   $ det job list
      # | ID       | Type            | Job Name   | Priority | Submitted            | Slots (acquired/needed) | Status          | User

   $ det job update-batch 73853c5c.priority=1 0d714127.priority=1

   $ det job list
      # | ID       | Type            | Job Name   | Priority | Submitted            | Slots (acquired/needed) | Status          | User
