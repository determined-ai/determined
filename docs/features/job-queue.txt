 Queue Management
##################

The Determined Queue Management system extends the functionality of scheduler options to offer users
better functionality and control over scheduling decisions. Queue Management is currently in beta
and is available to the priority scheduler and the Kubernetes priority scheduler. It is available in
read-only mode, which allows users to observe all submitted jobs and their state, but does not allow
users to modify the position or any configuration options.

To view the jobs that are currently active in the cluster, use the following command in the CLI:

.. code:: bash

   det job list

This will display a table of results, ordered by scheduling order. Note that the scheduling order is
not necessarily the priority of the job. In addition to the order of the job, users can see the
state of the jobs and how many slots each job is using. Jobs can be in the following states: queued,
running, backfilled, or preempted. Jobs that have completed or errored out are not counted as active
and are omitted from this list.
