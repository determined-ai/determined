Follow these steps to see how to run your first experiment.

***************
 Prerequisites
***************

You must have a running Determined cluster with the CLI installed.

-  To set up a local cluster, visit :ref:`basic`.
-  To set up a remote cluster, visit the :ref:`Installation Guide <installation-guide>` where you'll
   find options for On Prem, AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, and Slurm.

*******************
 Run an Experiment
*******************

.. tabs::

   .. tab::

      locally

      Train a single model for a fixed number of batches, using constant values for all
      hyperparameters on a single *slot*. A slot is a CPU or CPU computing device, which the
      Determined master schedules to run.

      .. note::

         To run an experiment in a local training environment, your Determined cluster requires only
         a single CPU or GPU. A cluster is made up of a master and one or more agents. A single
         machine can serve as both a master and an agent.

      **Create the Experiment**

      #. Download and extract the tar file: :download:`mnist_pytorch.tgz
         <../examples/mnist_pytorch.tgz>`.

      #. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the tar file.

         The ``const.yaml`` file is a YAML-formatted :ref:`experiment configuration
         <experiment-config-reference>` file that corresponds to an example experiment.

      #. Create an experiment that specifies the ``const.yaml`` configuration file by typing the
         following :ref:`CLI <cli-ug>` command.

         .. code:: bash

            det experiment create const.yaml .

         The final dot (.) argument uploads all of the files in the current directory as the
         *context directory* for your model. Determined copies the model context directory contents
         to the trial container working directory.

      **View the Experiment**

      #. To view the experiment in your browser:

         -  Enter the following URL: **http://localhost:8080/**. This is the cluster address for
            your local training environment.
         -  Accept the default username of ``determined``, and click **Sign In**. You'll create a
            strong password in the next section.

      #. Navigate to the home page and then visit your **Uncategorized** experiments.

      #. Select the experiment to display the experiment’s details such as Metrics.

      **Create a Strong Password**

      #. Select your profile in the upper left corner and then choose **Settings**.
      #. Edit the **Password** by typing a strong password.
      #. Select the checkmark to save your changes.

      If you are changing your password, the system asks you to confirm your change. The system lets
      you know your changes have been saved.

   .. tab::

      remotely

      Run a remote distributed training job.

      .. note::

         To run a remote distributed training job, you'll need a Determined cluster with multiple
         GPUs. In distributed training, A cluster is made up of a master and one or more agents. The
         master provides centralized management of the agent resources. By default, the
         :ref:`slots-per-trial` value is set to ``1`` which disables distributed training.

      #. Download and extract the tar file: :download:`mnist_pytorch.tgz
         <../examples/mnist_pytorch.tgz>`.

      #. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you extracted the tar file.

      #. Using your code editor, examine the ``distributed.yaml`` file. Notice the
         ``resources.slots_per_trial`` field is set to a value of ``8``:

         .. code:: yaml

            resources:
               slots_per_trial: 8

         This is the number of available GPU resources. The ``slots_per_trial`` value must be
         divisible by the number of GPUs per machine.

         -  If necessary, use your code editor to change the value to match your hardware
            configuration.

      #. Sign in to your remote instance of Determined:

         -  Enter the URL of your remote instance: **http://<ipAddress>:8080/**.
         -  Sign in using your username and password.

      #. To connect to the Determined master running on your remote instance, set the remote IP
         address and port number in the ``DET_MASTER`` environment variable:

         .. code:: bash

            export DET_MASTER=<ipAddress>:8080

      #. To create and run the experiment, run the following command, replacing ``<username>`` with
         your username.

         .. code:: bash

            det -u <username> experiment create distributed.yaml .

         -  The system will ask for your password.

      #. In your browser, navigate to the home page and then visit **Your Recent Submissions**.

      #. Select the experiment to display the experiment’s details such as Metrics. Notice the loss
         curve is similar to the locally-run, single-GPU experiment but the time to complete the
         trial is reduced by about half.

**Want to learn how to adapt your existing model code to Determined?**

The behavior of an experiment is configured via an experiment configuration, or YAML, file. A
configuration file is typically passed as a command-line argument when an experiment is created with
the :ref:`CLI <cli-ug>`.

-  Visit the :ref:`experiment-config-reference` for a complete description of the experiment
   configuration file.
-  Visit the :ref:`api-core-ug` for a walk-through of how to adapt your existing model code to
   Determined using the PyTorch MNIST model.
