 How Determined Works
######################

With Determined you can:

-  Use state-of-the-art distributed training to train models faster without changing model code.
-  Automatically find high-quality models using advanced hyperparameter tuning.
-  Get more from your GPUs and reduce cloud GPU costs with preemptible instances and smart
   scheduling.
-  Leverage experiment tracking out-of-the-box to track and reproduce your work, tracking code
   versions, metrics, checkpoints, and hyperparameters.
-  Continue using popular deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch by simply
   integrating the Determined API with your existing model code.

Determined integrates these features into an easy-to-use, high-performance deep learning environment
so you can spend your time building models instead of managing infrastructure.
