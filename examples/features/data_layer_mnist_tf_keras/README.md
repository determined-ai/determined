# TensorFlow (tf.keras) Data Layer Example

This folder contains the example code to showcase the data layer in Determined.

## Explanation:
The data layer in Determined enables high-performance data loading for deep learning training. 
Modern deep learning data-loading APIs do not always provide both a random-access layer and a 
sequential layer. This makes them inefficient solutions for performing many common deep learning 
workflows. Determined integrates the data layer with [YogaDL](https://github.com/determined-ai/yogadl) 
to provide a better approach to data-loading. For more information, see our docs 
[here](https://docs.determined.ai/latest/how-to/data-layer.html?highlight=data%20layer).
