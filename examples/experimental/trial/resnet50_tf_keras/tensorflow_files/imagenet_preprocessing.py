"""Provides utilities to preprocess images.

Training images are sampled using the provided bounding boxes, and subsequently
cropped to the sampled bounding box. Images are additionally flipped randomly,
then resized to the target output size (without aspect-ratio preservation).

Images used during evaluation are resized (with aspect-ratio preservation) and
centrally cropped.

All images undergo mean color subtraction.

Note that these steps are colloquially referred to as "ResNet preprocessing,"
and they differ from "VGG preprocessing," which does not use bounding boxes
and instead does an aspect-preserving resize followed by random crop during
training. (These both differ from "Inception preprocessing," which introduces
color distortion steps.)
