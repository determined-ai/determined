# PyTorch ImageNet Tutorial
This tutorial shows how to port PyTorch ImageNet example to
Determined's PyTorch API. This example is adapted from this [PyTorch ImageNet
tutorial](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet).

## Files
* **model_def.py**: The core code for the model. This includes building and compiling the model.

### Configuration Files
* **const.yaml**: Train the model with constant hyperparameter values.
* **distributed.yaml**: Same as `const.yaml`, but trains the model with multiple GPUs (distributed training).
* **const_cifar.yaml**: Train the model with constant hyperparameter values using the CIFAR10 dataset.
* **distributed_cifar.yaml**: Same as `const_cifar.yaml`, but trains the model with multiple GPUs (distributed training).

## Data
The original implementation uses the ImageNet dataset which can be downloaded [here](https://image-net.org/).
If you can not access the ImageNet dataset, the CIFAR10 dataset can be used to get a running
version of the example by loading in directly from the torchvision dataset.

## To Run
If you have not yet installed Determined, installation instructions can be found
under `docs/install-admin.html` or at https://docs.determined.ai/latest/index.html

Run the following command: `det -m <master host:port> experiment create -f
const.yaml .`. The other configurations can be run by specifying the appropriate
configuration file in place of `const.yaml`.
