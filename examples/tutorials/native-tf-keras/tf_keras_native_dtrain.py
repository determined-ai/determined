Native API: Distributed Training
================================

One powerful application of the Native API is that it can be used to seamlessly
launch distributed training jobs (both single and multi instance) with a
minimal set of code changes. This example builds on top of
:ref:`tutorials_native-api-basics` to demonstrate this.

# First, configure the ``resources.slots_per_trial`` field in the experiment
# configuration to choose the number of :ref:`slots<terminology-concepts>` to
# train on. You should ensure that the Determined cluster you're using to launch
# the experiment has a sufficient amount of slots available. In the example
# above, we have configured the experiment to use 8 slots (GPUs) to train a
# single model in parallel.
#
# In this case, we've configured our experiment to use a ``global_batch_size``
# of 256 across all slots, or a sub-batch size of 32 on each slot.

#
# Now, configure and launch the training job as done in
# :ref:`tutorials_native-api-basics`. Note that no code changes are required to
# scale up to distributed training.
#
# We use
# :py:func:`~determined.keras.TFKerasNativeContext.get_per_slot_batch_size()` to
# set the framework ``batch_size`` argument. Determined will handle initializing
# the context of each distributed training worker such that it's sub-batch size
# is returned by this function. Because Determined manipulates the batch size
# as a first-class configuration property, ``global_batch_size`` is a required
# hyperparameter in all experiments.
