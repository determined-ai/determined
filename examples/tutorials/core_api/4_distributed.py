"""
Stage 4: Let's do all the same things, but across multiple workers.

Multi-slot tasks in Determined get the following features out-of-the box:
- batch scheduling
- IP address coordination between workers
- distributed communication primitives
- coordinated cross-worker preemption support
- checkpoint download sharing between workers on the same node
