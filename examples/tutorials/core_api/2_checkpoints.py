"""
Stage 2: Let's add checkpointing and preemption support to our "training" code.  After this, we will
be able to stop and continue training in two different ways: either by pausing and reactivating
training via the Determined WebUI, or by clicking the "Continue Trial" button after the experiment
has completed.

Note that these two forms of continuing have different behaviors.  While we always want to preserve
the value we are incrementing (our "model weight"), we don't always want to preserve the batch
index.  When we pause and reactive we want training to continue from the same batch index, but
when starting a fresh experiment we need training to start with a fresh batch index as well.  We
save the trial ID in the checkpoint and use that to distinguish the two types of continues.
