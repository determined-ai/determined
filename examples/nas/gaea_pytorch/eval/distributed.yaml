# Recommended settings:
#   - Nvidia Tesla V100: set batch size to 1024 and slots_per_trial to 8
#   - Nvidia Tesla K80: 
#       - set batch size to 2048 and slots_per_trial to 24 and increase learning_rate to 1.

data:
  # Change bucket_name to GCP bucket with imagenet dataset
  # Data folder structure assumed to be imagenet/train and 
  # imagenet/validation for the two data splits.
  #
  # If bucket_name is null, we will run with randomly 
  # generated data.

  # If streaming is true, we will send request to bucket
  # every time an image is requested.  If false, we will
  # save data to disk and load that the next time the
  # image is requested.  We recommend streaming=true
  # to avoid having to mount directories to docker container 
  # and guarantee good performance regardless of disk speed.
  streaming: true
  # This folder is only used if streaming is false.
  # This should probably match the container_path
  # in a provided bind mount.

# Uncomment this if you want to mount a host directory to the 
# docker container.
