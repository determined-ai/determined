# A grid search over multiple prompts and pipeline settings.

# Due to tensorboard limitations, one should keep batch_size * max_length <= 10 in order for all
# generated images to be easily viewable in tensorboard.  Scanning over generator seeds is the
# easiest way to get more samples while also diversifying the results.
