# This is the number of GPUs there are per machine. Determined uses this information when

# GPUs. Distributed tasks with sizes that are not divisible by `maxSlotsPerPod` are never scheduled.

## Configure the task container defaults. Tasks include trials, commands, tensorboards notebooks and shells.
## For all task containers, shm_size_bytes and network_mode are configurable. For trials, the
## network interface used by distributed (multi-machine) training and ports used by the NCCL and
## GLOO libraries during distributed training are configurable. These default to auto-discovery and
## random non-privileged ports, respectively.
