# This is the number of GPUs there are per machine. Determined uses this information when
# scheduling multi-GPU tasks. Each multi-GPU (distributed training) task will be scheduled as
# a set of `slotsPerTask / slotsPerNode` separate pods, with each pod assigned to `slotsPerNode` GPUs.
# Tasks sizes that are not divisible by `slotsPerNode` are never scheduled. If you have a cluster of
# different size nodes (e.g., 4 and 8 GPUs per node), set the `slotsPerNode` to the smallest
# common denominator.

## Configure the task container defaults. Tasks include trials, commands, tensorboards notebooks and shells.
## For all task containers, shm_size_bytes and network_mode are configurable. For trials, the
## network interface used by distributed (multi-machine) training and ports used by the NCCL and
## GLOO libraries during distributed training are configurable. These default to auto-discovery and
## random non-privileged ports, respectively.
