This branch contains the files for the helm chart repository hosted via
github pages. The contents are autogenerated. Please leave it alone. :)

One important thing to note, however: the .tgz files are not actually gzipped tarballs.  They are markdown files which, when Jekyll renders github pages, generate redirects to the actual charts published as release artifacts in the GitHub repo.  The filename is just the URL to be redirected.  Don't worry, we're not putting binaries into git; we're not monsters.
