/*
Package lttb includes a Go rewrite of Sveinn Steinarsson's reference implementation (written in
JavaScript) of the Largest-Triangle-Three-Buckets algorithm as described in his thesis,
"Downsampling Time Series for Visual Representation":

As far as translation makes possible, the original algorithm, variable names, and comments are
unmodified. The accompanying tests were added after the Go rewrite. The following copyright notice
