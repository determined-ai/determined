trial/command/checkpoint gc actor -> create allocation actor, hands it sproto.AllocateRequest

allocation actor requests resources (allocate req) -> rm

rm -> resources (sproto.ResourceList) to allocation actor

allocation actor wants to start resources, needs task spec

allocation actor asks parent for task spec -> trial/command/checkpoint gc..
                                           <- parent sends task spec back

allocation actor starts resources (res.Start(ctx, taskSpec, rri))
    res.Start actually talks to agent actor
