"""
THIS LOG SHIPPER MUST ONLY SHIP LOGS.

It is not allowed to depend on any libraries other than python standard libraries, including our own
determined library.  The reason is that python virtual env errors in user containers are common
scenarios for users to encounter, and we must be able to still ship logs in those scenarios.

The only thing that is allowed to break the log shipper is a misconfigured cluster (if the log
shipper isn't able to connect to the master) or if python isn't installed.

But if you are thinking of making this log shipper do anything other than ship logs, or if you are
thinking of adding any dependencies not inside the standard library, stop.  Let the log shipper
just ship logs; it's too important of a job to mix it with anything else.

---

ship_logs.py: a suitable container entrypoint that ships logs from a child process to the master.

usage: ship_logs.py CMD ARGS...

ship_logs.py will read environment variables set by the master to obtain its configuration.  It
isn't intended to be useful in any non-managed environments.
