# settings as they are set for experiment or notebook configs, while still
# allowing customizations via normal ssh mechanisms.

# Not all variables should be overwritten this way; the HOME variable should be
# set by ssh, and the TERM, LANG, and LC_* variables should be passed in from
# the client.
#
# Normal mechanisms like a ~/.bashrc will override these variables.

# After openssh 8+ is the only version of openssh supported (that is, after we
# only support ubuntu >= 20.04), we can use the more obvious SetEnv option and
# skip this awkwardness.
