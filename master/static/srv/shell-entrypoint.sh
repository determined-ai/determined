# Prepend each key in authorized_keys with a set of environment="KEY=VALUE"
# options to inject the entire docker environment into the eventual ssh
# session via an options in the authorized keys file.  See syntax described in
# `man 8 sshd`.  The purpose of this is to honor the environment variable
# settings as they are set for experiment or notebook configs, while still
# allowing customizations via normal ssh mechanisms.
#
# Not all variables should be overwritten this way; the HOME variable should be
# set by ssh, and the TERM, LANG, and LC_* variables should be passed in from
# the client.
#
# Normal mechanisms like a ~/.bashrc will override these variables.
#
# After openssh 8+ is the only version of openssh supported (that is, after we
# only support ubuntu >= 20.04), we can use the more obvious SetEnv option and
# skip this awkwardness.
#
# For HPC systems, bash module support uses variables that store functions
# of the form below (with embedded parenthesis or %% in the name).
#   BASH_FUNC_ml()=() {  eval $($LMOD_DIR/ml_cmd "$@")
