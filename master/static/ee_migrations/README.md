# EE Database Migrations

This directory contains the migrations previously exclusive to our enterprise edition.
These migrations have since been packaged into the `oss-to-ee-catch-up` migration, found in the
database migrations subdirectory. This directory exists purely for posterity and in the event
a user requires a database down migration that includes EE tables.
