class Stream:

    Stream is a client to the Determined streaming updates system featuring auto-reconnects.

    Streaming updates is a mechanism for efficiently monitoring entities in the Determined platform.
    For example, you could stream all metrics from a run or all checkpoints from a trial, or the
    state of one or more experiments.

    The Stream can be iterated over to read events related to subscriptions.  A subscription is set
    with .subscribe().  There is only ever one active subscription at a time.  Each call to
    .subscribe() causes the stream to yield a Sync(complete=False) message, followed by any number
    of subscription-related messages, then a Sync(complete=True) message.  The second Sync indicates
    that the client has loaded all state from the Determined master, and additional
    subscription-related messages are yielded as the master publishes them, unless another call to
    .subscribe() has been made.

    If another .subscribe() call has been made, the Stream will cease to yield messages from the
    first subscription and will begin with the Sync(complete=False) message from the second
    subscription, and then the second subscription continues in the manner of the first.

    The behavior of the Stream while streaming could be described by the following steps:

      1. Begin by sending the subscription message for A

      2. Ignore all messages until the sync start message for A

      3. Collect all offline messages for A, until the sync end message for A.

      4. Collect online messages for A until another .subscribe() call has been made.

      5. Start from step 1 again with the new subscription.
