    WorkloadResponseInterceptor is a class that can send some precanned workload messages, as the

    unit tests need to be written as WorkloadIterators (i.e. generator coroutines).

            # Yield some workload message to the TrialController.
            yield from interceptor.send(my_workload, my_workload_args)
