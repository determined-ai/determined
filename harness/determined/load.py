def trial_class_from_entrypoint(entrypoint_spec: str) -> Type[det.LegacyTrial]:
    """
    Load and initialize a Trial class from an entrypoint specification.

    An entrypoint specification is expected to take the form:

        "<module>:<object reference>"

    <module> specifies the module containing the trial class within the model
    definition, relative to the root.

    <object reference> specifies the naming of the trial class within the
    module. It may be a nested object delimited by dots.

    Examples:

        "model_def:CIFAR10Trial": expects a "CIFAR10Trial" class that is
        defined in a file model_def.py

        "my_lib.trial:trial_classes.NestedTrial": expects a "NestedTrial"
        class that is an attribute of `trial_classes`, where `trial_classes` is
        defined in a file my_lib/trial.py

    Note that this follows the entrypoints specification loading logic defined
    in [1] with a single difference: the directory name of the model definition
    is prefixed to <module>, or used as the module if <module> is empty.
