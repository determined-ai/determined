class CheckpointLoadContext(pytorch.PyTorchTrialContext):
    """
    CheckpointLoadContext is a special PyTorchTrialContext that can be used to load Trial classes
    outside of normal training loops.
    It does not support actually reporting metrics to a real master or uploading checkpoints or any
    of the normal behaviors associated with model training.  :func:`determined.pytorch.init()`
    should still be used for normal training.
    CheckpointLoadContext is meant to be used by users using the PyTorchTrial Trainer directly.
    Users using the Trainer might prefer CheckpointLoadContext because it allows them to create a
    Trial class with extra parameters they may have added.
    Users who are relying on the legacy `entrypoint: my_model:MyTrainer` way of launching their code
    should continue to use :func:`~determined.pytorch.load_trial_from_checkpoint_path()`.
    Example usage:
    .. code:: python
       import determined as det
       from determined import pytorch
       from determined.experimental import client
       # Download checkpoint and load training code from checkpoint.
       path = client.get_checkpoint(MY_UUID)
       with det.import_from_path(path + "/code/"):
           import my_model_def
       # Create CheckpointLoadContext for instantiating trial.
       context = pytorch.CheckpointLoadContext()
       # Instantiate trial with context and any other args.
       my_trial = my_model_def.MyTrial(context, ...)
