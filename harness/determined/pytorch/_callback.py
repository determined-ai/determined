class PyTorchCallback:
    """
    Abstract base class used to define a callback that should execute during
    the lifetime of a PyTorchTrial.

    .. warning::
        If you are defining a stateful callback (e.g., it mutates a ``self``
        attribute over its lifetime), you must also override :meth:`state_dict()` and
        :meth:`load_state_dict()` to ensure this state can be serialized and deserialized
        over checkpoints.

    .. warning::
        If distributed training is enabled, every GPU will execute a copy of this callback
        (except for :meth:`on_validation_end`, :meth:`on_validation_step_end` and
        :meth:`on_checkpoint_end`). To configure a callback implementation to execute on a subset of
        GPUs, please condition your implementation on ``trial.context.distributed.get_rank()``.
