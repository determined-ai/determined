"""
The ``client`` module exposes many of the same capabilities as the ``det`` CLI tool directly to
Python code with an object-oriented interface.

As a simple example, let's walk through the most basic workflow for creating an experiment,
waiting for it to complete, and finding the top-performing checkpoint.

The first step is to import the ``client`` module and possibly to call
:func:`~determined.experimental.client.login`:

.. code:: python

   from determined.experimental import client

   # If you have called `det user login`, environment variables will have been set such that
   # logging in with `login` is unnecessary:
   # client.login(master=..., user=..., password=...)

The next step is to call :func:`~determined.experimental.client.create_experiment`:

.. code:: python

   # config can be a path to a config file or a python dict of the config.
   exp = client.create_experiment(config="my_config.yaml", model_dir=".")
   print(f"started experiment {exp.id}")

The returned object will be an :class:`~determined.experimental.client.Experiment`
which has methods for controlling the lifetime of the experiment running on the cluster.
In this example, we will just wait for the experiment to complete.

.. code:: python

   exit_status = exp.wait()
   print(f"experiment completed with status {exit_status}")

Now that the experiment has completed, you can grab the top-performing checkpoint from training:

.. code:: python

   best_checkpoint = exp.list_checkpoints()[0]
   print(f"best checkpoint was {best_checkpoint.uuid}")


See :ref:`use-trained-models` for more ideas on what to do next.

    ``login()`` will configure the default Determined() singleton used by all of the other functions
    in the client module.

    It is often unnecessary to call ``login()``.  If you have configured your environment so that
    the Determined CLI works without any extra arguments or environment variables, you should not
    have to call ``login()`` at all.

    If you do need to call ``login()``, it must be called before any calling any other functions
    from this module, otherwise it will fail.

    If you have reason to connect to multiple masters, you should use explicit
    :class:`~determined.experimental.client.Determined` objects instead.  Each explicit
    :class:`~determined.experimental.client.Determined` object accepts the same parameters as
    ``login()``, and offers the same functions as what are offered in this module.

    .. note::

       Try to avoid having your password in your python code.  If you are running on your local
       machine, you should always be able to use ``det user login`` on the CLI, and ``login()``
       will not need either a user or a password.  If you have ran ``det user login`` with multiple
       users (and you have not ran ``det user logout``), then you should be able to run
       ``login(user=...)`` for any of those users without putting your password in your code.

    Args:
        master (string, optional): The URL of the Determined master.
            If this argument is not specified, the environment variables
            DET_MASTER and DET_MASTER_ADDR will be checked for the master URL in that order.
        user (string, optional): The Determined username used for
            authentication. (default: ``determined``)
        password (string, optional): The password associated with the user.
        cert_path (string, optional): A path to a custom PEM-encoded certificate,
            against which to validate the master.  (default: ``None``)
        cert_name (string, optional): The name of the master hostname to use during certificate
            validation. Normally this is taken from the master URL, but there may be cases where
            the master is exposed on multiple networks that this value might need to be
            overridden. (default: ``None``)
