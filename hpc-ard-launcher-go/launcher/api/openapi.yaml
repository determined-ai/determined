          \ that per the specification range boundaries are always inclusive.\n\n\
          If a range is statisfiable you will receive a 206 Partial Content response\

          \ line \nranges are used in this way the returned Content-Range header may\
          \ not match the lines returned because\nthe server does not know in advance\
          \ how many lines are in the resource.  However the starting line will\n\

        \ as byte ranges except using lines instead of bytes as the unit.  The main\n\
        difference between byte and line ranges is that byte ranges use zero based\
        \ indexing whereas line ranges\nuse 1 based indexing.  So a range of 1-5 would\
        \ be the 2nd through 6th bytes but the 1st through 5th \nlines.  Note that\
        \ per the specification range boundaries are always inclusive.\n\nIf a range\
        \ is statisfiable you will receive a 206 Partial Content response with a Content-Range\
        \ header\nindicating the portion of the resource returned.  If the range is\
        \ unsatisfiable then you will receive a\n416 Range Unsatisfiable response.\
        \  If the range matches the full size of the content then you will just\n\
        receive a 200 OK response with the full resource.\n\nRange specifications\
        \ that are invalid are silently discarded and will just result in the server\
        \ returning\na normal 200 OK response.\n\nRanges can be specified relative\
        \ to the start/end of the content per RFC 7233.  Note that when line \nranges\
        \ are used in this way the returned Content-Range header may not match the\
        \ lines returned because\nthe server does not know in advance how many lines\
        \ are in the resource.  However the starting line will\nalways be correct\
        \ and thus can be used by clients to display line numbers if they so wish.\n\
