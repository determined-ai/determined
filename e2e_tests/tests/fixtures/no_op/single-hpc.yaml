# For HPC, we need do not specify the "checkpoint_storage" in this configuration
# and, instead, use the "checkpoint_storage" specified in the "master.yaml" that
# is used to run the HPC cluster tests.  This is because the "master.yaml" will
# contain a "checkpoint_storage" whose "host_path" is set to a shared directory,
# instead of "/tmp".  This is done when running tests on HPC clusters for the
# following two reasons:
#
#    1. The "storage_path:" directory, which is set to
#       "determined-integration-checkpoints" in the configuration file,
#       disappears as soon as the experiment is paused. Don't know the
#       reason why it disappears, but it only happens if "host_path" is
#       set to "/tmp".  This causes the "activate" to fail, because it
#       cannot find the checkpoints from the previously paused experiment.
#
#    2. On HPC clusters, there is no guarantee that when the experiment is
#       "activated" after it has been paused, that the Workload Manager
#       (e.g., Slurm, PBS) is going to pick the same node that the job
#       previously ran on when it was paused.  If it picks a different node
#       and "host_path" is not a shared directory, then the new node on
#       which the job is restarted on will not have access to the checkpoint
#       directory.  This will cause the experiment to fail, because it
#       cannot find the checkpoints from the previously paused experiment.
