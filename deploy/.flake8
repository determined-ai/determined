# We ignore F401 in __init__.py because it is expected for there to be
# "unused imports" when defining a "regular" package. (This file is
# implicitly executed when the package is imported, and the imports would
# be used by the importer.) We ignore patch_saver_restore.py because it includes
# a near-verbatim TensorFlow function with a small patch.

# Explanations for ignored error codes:
# - D1* (no missing docstrings): too much effort to start enforcing
# - D200 (short docstring must fit in one line with quotes): stylistic choice
# - D202 (no blank lines after function docstrings): stylistic choice
# - D203 (blank line before class docstring): stylistic choice
# - D205 (blank line between summary and description): not enforcing single-line summaries
# - D212 (docstring should start on first line): stylistic choice (prefer D213, docstrings start on second line)
# - D4* (docstring content warnings): too much effort to start enforcing
# - E203 (no space before colon): not PEP8-compliant; triggered by Black-formatted code
# - W503 (no line breaks before binary operator): not PEP8-compliant; triggered by Black-formatted code
# - C812-C816 (missing trailing comma): stylistic choice
