# startup_input is how you configure the UI.  It's literally just a set of keys
# that will be passed into the UI as if you typed them.  This key will turn
# off the db logs:
# startup_input: "!"

# You might overwrite it if you wanted to run multiple concurrent clusters.
# temp_dir: /tmp/devcluster

# stages is the configuration of the whole cluster.  Each stage must be
# completed before moving to the next stage, so order matters.  This example
# assumes that devcluster.py is responsible for the database, but if you wanted
# to run it externally then you could just remove the "db" stage here.

      # is not present, the database will not persist at all.

  # master is a predefined type of stage for to how determined runs the master.
  - master:
      # pre is a set of precommands to be run before starting the master.

      # probably don't have to change these from the default unless you change
      # the http_port for the master:
      # post:
      #   - conn_check
      #       host: localhost
      #       port: 8080
