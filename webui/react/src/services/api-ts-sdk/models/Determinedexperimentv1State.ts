/**
 * Determined API (Beta)
 * Determined helps deep learning teams train models more quickly, easily share GPU resources, and effectively collaborate. Determined allows deep learning engineers to focus on building and training models at scale, without needing to worry about DevOps or writing custom code for common tasks like fault tolerance or experiment tracking.  You can think of Determined as a platform that bridges the gap between tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch --- which work great for a single researcher with a single GPU --- to the challenges that arise when doing deep learning at scale, as teams, clusters, and data sets all increase in size.

/**
 * The current state of the experiment.
 * 
 *  - STATE_UNSPECIFIED: The state of the experiment is unknown.
 *  - STATE_ACTIVE: The experiment is in an active state.
 *  - STATE_PAUSED: The experiment is in a paused state
 *  - STATE_STOPPING_COMPLETED: The experiment is completed and is shutting down.
 *  - STATE_STOPPING_CANCELED: The experiment is canceled and is shutting down.
 *  - STATE_STOPPING_ERROR: The experiment is errored and is shutting down.
 *  - STATE_COMPLETED: The experiment is completed and is shut down.
 *  - STATE_CANCELED: The experiment is canceled and is shut down.
 *  - STATE_ERROR: The experiment is errored and is shut down.
 *  - STATE_DELETED: The experiment has been deleted.
 *  - STATE_DELETING: The experiment is deleting.
 *  - STATE_DELETE_FAILED: The experiment failed to delete.
 *  - STATE_STOPPING_KILLED: The experiment is killed and is shutting down.
 *  - STATE_QUEUED: The experiment is queued (waiting to be run, or job state is still queued).
 * Queued is a substate of the Active state.
 *  - STATE_PULLING: The experiment is pulling the image. Pulling is a substate of the Active
 * state.
 *  - STATE_STARTING: The experiment is preparing the environment after finishing pulling the
 * image. Starting is a substate of the Active state.
 *  - STATE_RUNNING: The experiment has an allocation actively running.
 * Running is a substate of the Active state.
