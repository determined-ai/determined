/**
 * Determined API (Beta)
 * Determined helps deep learning teams train models more quickly, easily share GPU resources, and effectively collaborate. Determined allows deep learning engineers to focus on building and training models at scale, without needing to worry about DevOps or writing custom code for common tasks like fault tolerance or experiment tracking.  You can think of Determined as a platform that bridges the gap between tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch --- which work great for a single researcher with a single GPU --- to the challenges that arise when doing deep learning at scale, as teams, clusters, and data sets all increase in size.

 *  - SORT_BY_UNSPECIFIED: Returns trials in an unsorted list.
 *  - SORT_BY_ID: Returns trials sorted by id.
 *  - SORT_BY_START_TIME: Return trials sorted by start time.
 *  - SORT_BY_END_TIME: Return trials sorted by end time. Trials without end times are

 *  - SORT_BY_LATEST_VALIDATION_METRIC: Return the trials sorted by the latest metric so far, where the metric is
 * specified by `searcher.metric` in the experiment configuration.
 *  - SORT_BY_BATCHES_PROCESSED: Return the trials sorted by the number of batches completed.
 *  - SORT_BY_DURATION: Return the trials sorted by the total duration.
