# E2E

## Framework

Deteremined AI uses [Playwright ðŸŽ­](https://playwright.dev/).

## How to run locally

- Create `.env` file in `webui/react` like `webui/react/.env`
- Add env variables `PW_USER_NAME`, `PW_PASSWORD`, and `PW_SERVER_ADDRESS` (`PW_` prefix stands for Playwright)
  - `PW_USER_NAME`: user name for determined account
  - `PW_PASSWORD`: password for determined account
  - `PW_SERVER_ADDRESS`: API server address
- Run `npx playwright install`
- Run `SERVER_ADDRESS={set server address} npm run build` in `webui/react`
  - It is `SERVER_ADDRESS` here. not `PW_SERVER_ADDRESS`, but the both values should be the same
- Run `npm run e2e` in `webui/react`

\*\*Avoid using `make` command because it does not take env variables

### Quick start testing using det deploy

If you don't want to use dev cluster, you can use det deploy to initiate the backend. These commands should run and pass tests on chrome:

1. `det deploy local cluster-up --det-version="0.29.0" --no-gpu --master-port=8080`
   - use whatever det-version you want here.
2. `SERVER_ADDRESS="http://localhost:8080" npm run build --prefix webui/react`
3. Optional if you want an experiment created for the test: `det experiment create ./examples/tutorials/mnist_pytorch/const.yaml ./examples/tutorials/mnist_pytorch/`
4. To run the tests: `CI=true PW_SERVER_ADDRESS="http://localhost:8080"  PW_USER_NAME="admin" PW_PASSWORD="" npm run e2e --prefix webui/react -- --project=chromium-no-cors`
   - `CI=true` currently causes Playwright to start a frontend webserver for the test. If `CI=false` you'll need to do `npm run preview` manually and point the tests at the right port.

## CI

CI is setup as `test-e2e-react` in `.circleci/config.yml`.

We use `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright` for [docker container](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker).
Update the docker image version along with Playwright version.
