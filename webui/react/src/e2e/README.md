# E2E

## Framework

Deteremined AI uses [Playwright ðŸŽ­](https://playwright.dev/).

## How to run locally

- Create `.env` file in `webui/react` like `webui/react/.env`
- Add env variables `PW_USER_NAME`, `PW_PASSWORD`, and `PW_SERVER_ADDRESS` (`PW_` prefix stands for Playwright)
  - `PW_USER_NAME`: user name for determined account
  - `PW_PASSWORD`: password for determined account
  - `PW_SERVER_ADDRESS`: API server address
- Run `SERVER_ADDRESS={set server address} npm run build` in `webui/react`
  - It is `SERVER_ADDRESS` here. not `PW_SERVER_ADDRESS`, but the both values should be the same
- Run `npm run e2e` in `webui/react`

\*\*Avoid using `make` command because it does not take env variables

## CI

CI is setup as `test-e2e-react` in `.circleci/config.yml`.

We use `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright` for [docker container](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker).
Update the docker image version along with Playwright version.
