# Determined's Model-Hub Library

Determined's Model-Hub library makes it super easy to use popular external
libraries with Determined's training platform.  Support for each external
library will provide a Trial interface, helper functions, and official examples
to allows users to easily use these libraries with all of Determined features
(e.g., distributed training, experiment tracking, hyperparameter search).

## Supported Libraries

Model-Hub currently supports

* [Huggingface transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
* [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)

https://docs.determined.ai/latest/model-hub/index.html) for more information on
how to use these libraries with Determined.
