# Determined's Model-Hub Library
Determined's Model-Hub library makes it super easy to use popular external libraries with 
Determined's training platform.  Support for each external library will provide a Trial interface,
helper functions, and official examples to allows users to easily use these libraries with all of 
Determined features (e.g., distributed training, experiment tracking, hyperparameter search).

## Supported Libraries
Model-Hub currently supports 
[Huggingface transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

Libraries we are working to support in the future include:
* [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)
* [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)

If there is a library you want us to support for use with Determined, please open an issue
to submit a request.
